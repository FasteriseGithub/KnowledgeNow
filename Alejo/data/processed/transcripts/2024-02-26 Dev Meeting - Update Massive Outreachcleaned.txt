Speaker 4
I meant to move all my site packages to the wrong thing. I meant to move like one thing and I moved the whole site package directory to the wrong thing. I had to reinstall everything.

Speaker 2
That sucks. Wait, you moved it like you don't.

Speaker 4
Know where or like I know where. I moved it all into a text file with a JSON text file. I was trying to do something the other way around. I just messed it up. But now I've fixed it. Have you ever used the Kaggle API?

Speaker 2
No.

Speaker 4
Okay, so I'll share my screen because I'm kind of stuck right now. I've fixed it, but now I'm at the point where it should work and it's not working. But I fixed my previous errors. Can you give me share screen?

Speaker 2
There we go.

Speaker 4
I just got one off Kaggle. So which screen am I sharing?

Speaker 2
You're sharing Jupyter notebooks right now?

Speaker 4
Yes. So the way you do it is I'm going to have to add more sharing options. That should be enough.

Speaker 4
Can you see the terminal?

Speaker 4
So I've moved into the Kaggle JSON because basically the Kaggle file just looks like this. It's just got username, the API key. And you got to move it into a certain directory and then you're meant to be able to haggle datasets download and then just the dataset name. But now it's saying it's missing username and configuration. But I know it's not because I just checked.

Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah. No, it is looking in the right folder and I know that because I've had other errors where it wasn't looking in the right folder and it said move it into the right folder.

Speaker 2
What if we go to that location on your computer?

Speaker 2
Copy that? You copy the users all the way up to the, and now go to terminal and go CD and now paste and we're going to remove the last py file. We're just going to go into the directory.

Speaker 2
Okay, so that's funny. We're going to say sudo.

Speaker 4
Oh yeah, I've done that. And then.

Speaker 2
You put your computer password.

Speaker 4
Yeah, I did.

Speaker 2
So you have to do pseudocd. There we go. Move the pY.

Speaker 4
What does Pseudo do?

Speaker 2
It's like your admin access. So you can access everything in the computer. Which is dangerous because you can also remove everything in the computer. Do ls weird. Strange.

Speaker 2
Do pseudo. Yeah. Okay. And now go CD to that folder.

Speaker 2
Now go lf. Yes. Okay, so load config is not in there. Oh, wait, load config is supposed to be in that kaggle API extended. So why don't you go nano? The command is called nano. You can use vim, too. But anyway, Kaggle API extended and tab completion should work, by the way. Okay, and now press enter. And if you go be. If you go down with your arrow keys. We're looking for load config. Keep going down.

Speaker 2
Okay, we will calculate PI copy name username key. Yes. Config file. It has to be different than that. Is that what the name was?

Speaker 4
Yeah, Kaggle Json inside of the.

Speaker 2
And the directory is called Kaggle config. Well, we pasted the directory from the error.

Speaker 2
Okay, you know what we're going to do? We're going to pause this now and make sure we get the right config directory later.

Speaker 2
Let's see. Did you get around to testing the new prompt?

Speaker 6
Yeah, I did, but I'm almost done with the icebreaker. I tested the prompt for the icebreaker and it did really well.

Speaker 2
Could you show us?

Speaker 6
Sure. Give me a minute.

Speaker 3
Are you guys actively using upwork or?

Speaker 2
Not actively. How come?

Speaker 3
I found some kind of automation to basically automate finding jobs through some feed like RSS, something like that, and making the proposals automatic. I think we could set this mean. I'm going hard on upwork now because we got the first client for celebrities, basically, like the most promising now through upwork. First it was just a little project, but then I make an upsell for something way bigger. I'm just busy making an offer for that, but for here, for pastorized, and for the whole future with me, with AI. And I guess you also maybe want to join this initiative to make this upwork. I'm visualizing it like a group initiative where we build the system, automate the stuff, and then we would also build something on top that would delegate those upwork jobs to the people that can actually do them. Or maybe like we could match in teams, something like that.

Speaker 2
I really like that idea. It feels like only a couple of steps away from what we're doing right now with the emails. Instead of LinkedIn profiles, you just get job descriptions.

Speaker 6
This is the icebreaker prompt. This is the result here. So I use Yalakun, that's like a chief researcher at Meta. So these are the thought. I was truly impressed by your work on projects like, could you share about your approach to data compression and intelligent data analysis in this project, giving your expertise in AI machinery robotic? I'm curious to know your thoughts on the future of computer vision technology. How do you see it evolving? Recombinate your background. So it brought out like five icebreakers that we could use. So this is the template I refined it to, like we discussed in the last. We discussed that I should remove the templates and I removed it. So I'm giving the AI a chance to generate email drafts by itself. So this is the way it came out. The prompt is not still very effective though, but it is using the icebreakers. The information I give it. I'll need your help with recrafting this email draft.

Speaker 6
So dear Yalakun, I hope this message finds you well. As a professor, researcher, and thought leader in AI, machine learning, deep learning, robotics, your contribution in this field has truly been remarkable. I'm reaching out to you on behalf of Fastrise, an AI-driven chatbot company that focuses on amplifying human potentials through AI automation.

I look forward to the possibility of working together and leveraging our expertise to drive AI innovation. Thank you for your time. Regards, Your Name, Your Title, FastRise Team.

Speaker 2
That is very solid. We'll work on making it sound more human and shorter and less formal, but other than that, it touches on all the points we wanted. There is one thing. Is this using the new knowledge base file?

Speaker 6
Not yet.

Speaker 2
It feels like it is, but yes. Other than that, this is good at saying, hey, I think there's alignment here and here, and I think this is why we can collaborate together. When it comes to cold emails, we're going to have to figure out the clear objective, what our offer really actually is, and how that aligns to who they are and what they do. So that's going to be, I think, a little bit extra prompting to make sure maybe it's always mention one of our products and why it would fit with them. Or maybe it's like, hey, make sure the call to action is very clear because there's not a clear next step that this person can do or follow other than saying partnership sounds great, but partnership of what?

Speaker 2
I think what you've built so far is great. So Kuba, what did you say to Bartek that you need help with refining?

Speaker 6
Yeah. This email prompts, I feel it could be better than this.

Speaker 3
You mean this is a new prompt, right?

Speaker 6
Yeah, this is like a new prompt. It generates this email. I feel it could be better with help.

Speaker 3
Can you say again if the prompt is better when you do it yourself?

Speaker 6
I used PFA, but with the recent prompts that you refined with the one you sent, the one in your GitHub repo, the output was much better than the prompt I was using before.

Speaker 2
Okay, so there's room for improvement. Awesome. Just to make sure you got that. Bartek, the prompt that you shared with us on GitHub is much better and I see what Kuba is saying regarding this prompt. It can be improved in that it's more aligned with our objective. For example, there it acknowledges the recipient's professional background and achievements using information which. Sure, yeah, that makes sense, but how do we tie it into how we can work together and what our actual offer and call to action are? So those are things that can be improved for sure. So if you guys can connect, maybe we go into a breakout room. And if you guys can connect now and work on just like the next version of this prompt, that would be awesome.Speaker 2
And I'll tell you what we can do. 

Speaker 3
No, I have idea, because this is the final prompt for making the actual email. 

Speaker 5
Right. 

Speaker 3
I'm thinking we should get sales team to think about the best template we can have. What should the email have? It's the best to give an example. Yeah, let the example be good thinking through by the people who are good at sales. 

Speaker 2
Okay. I think that's a really good call, dude. We'll come back to you with some improvements of what we want to specify in the prompt. The absolutely necessary things to make sure the prompt flows nicely. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, okay, sounds good. 

Speaker 2
I'll figure out how we go about that. 

Speaker 3
It can be example. There could be template of, say, components, like opening some kind of things. I don't know, there could be maybe hook or something, or hook, twist body, some kind of related stuff. And then later CTA, something like that. 

Speaker 2
You can give it a framework to follow. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, framework, definitely. That's good. 

Speaker 2
And to be fair, I know two. It's number one. 

Speaker 5
What do you call it? 

Speaker 2
Alex Ramosis and Nicos. I know those two, and they both seem very effective to me. So I'll come back to you with what we're following. A framework that we're following for the AI to go off of so it doesn't go into too long, like very long sentences and just focuses on. Yeah, sure. Acknowledge the professional background. That's a great idea. Acknowledge achievements and also come back to what is relevant to us. So, like, section that acknowledges professional background and section detailing potential synergy could be one sentence as opposed to two different sections. Okay, cool. I'll look into it and come back to you guys with a framework to use. Kuba, you mentioned the icebreaker. Would you show that to us again? 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 2
And the prompts are what? 

Speaker 6
These are the prompts. This is the prompt here. So the prompt back. Give. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
I'm very curious about this one. Do you have the example from before? So we could see where we improving. 

Speaker 6
So before were just using the icebreakers from an API, that proxy call. Let me just show you. So the icebreaker was. The icebreaker was just here, creating it here. So I just removed it because we had the discussion, me, Ali and Eric, we had a discussion, so decided we should remove the icebreaker, we should make it on its own. So I just removed it and this was the. 

Speaker 2
So Bartek is asking what were the results when were trying it before? So maybe in the version history of the notebook we could check what that looked like before, because he's trying to compare outputs, essentially he's trying to compare what improvement is thereafter. PFA gets run on the prompt. So I'm sure you can share the notebook with him later and he can check those out. 

Speaker 6
Yeah, sure, I'll show it to him. 

Speaker 2
I'd like to try one thing, which is putting all of this now that we have some better clarity, in a way, I'd like to put the knowledge base in there and maybe it's used as a tool. I don't see how there's a different way to use the knowledge base because it is a couple of pages of words, right? Using it as a knowledge base that gets access at every prompt, if that is feasible, using it as a system prompt. Either way it's going to consume a lot of tokens and that's fine because we need to test now, what does it look like? On the best possibility, this was good for 3.5. This was good for 3.5. 

Speaker 2
This is where we wanted to get to somewhere we're like, we're not going to use this simply because somebody's going to read this and know that it was maybe computer generated, but on GPT four latest model, what would that look like? So can we modify all of the LLms to use GPT four? 

Speaker 6
Yeah, sure. And yes, the knowledge base is going to better creating it too, for it. I was thinking about it earlier and thank God you brought it up. So creating a tool for our knowledge base is going to better. And yes, I just need to tweak it to using GPT four. 

Speaker 2
Sounds good. Yeah, GPT four turbo. And we'll get the best quality output we can. We'll also look at it against cost, but once we have some good example outputs, then we can step forward and say, hey, here are some good examples to follow. Here's the framework, here are some good examples to follow. And then we can call it and we'll have that because we have the contacts that we want to email, we have the industry that we want to do, which is real estate. So let's finish a solid base model using GPT four and integrating the knowledge base. We'll modify the prompts a bit. I'll get together with people in outreach to make sure that it's in the right direction. So knowledge base, GPT four turbo prompts, Cuba integrated knowledge base and the GBD four turbo. 

Speaker 2
And I'll get on the prompts and then we can have another look at it tomorrow. 

Speaker 3
About how we can make going to the better outputs more clear, like what we should do and how we should test that later on during the development. And I'm thinking either way we could make some kind of air table to have all the outputs going there, but that might be maybe overdoing. We could just have it actually sending a mail to some dummy email box and let's have all outputs in one place so we can compare them later. 

Speaker 5
Interesting. 

Speaker 2
What would be the easiest way to do that? 

Speaker 3
Probably comprehensive way where we could have AP call to airtable, let's say, and have every little output from here, like nitty gritty details of every agent output could be parsed to airtable and we could have good look at it. 

Speaker 2
That would be the best way of choosing the best outputs once again. Oh yeah. No, I think you're right. And that would be the best way to choose the best outputs. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. And if we make it like this inner table, every agent separately, we can also see where things are breaking if something goes wrong. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, okay, sounds good. Henry, could you set up an air table base? Okay, yeah. You're back. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, I just got back. 

Speaker 2
If you could quickly set up an air table base, we're going to keep the emails that we draft in there to be able to compare the quality of the different prompts and outputs. That'd be awesome. Other than that, we're talking about, let's write some stuff down. 

Speaker 5
Okay. We're talking GPT four. 

Speaker 2
We'Re talking. 

Speaker 5
Knowledge base. Cool. 

Speaker 2
And then we're talking, you should have. 

Speaker 4
Access to it as well. 

Speaker 2
Could you share the link? 

Speaker 4
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
You can just go into faster. 

Speaker 2
We're not paying, still paying thousands for airtable, are we? 

Speaker 5
No. Okay, good. 

Speaker 4
I think we might be still using credits. 

Speaker 2
What's the name of this base? 

Speaker 4
Fasterized dev team. If you go to workspaces, be on the left. Workspace settings, fasterized dev team. And then. 

Speaker 7
Hey guys, how are you doing? 

Speaker 2
Hey, Jorg, how's it going, man? 

Speaker 7
Doing great and good. 

Speaker 5
Good. 

Speaker 2
It's good to see you here, man. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, back. 

Speaker 7
Thank you. 

Speaker 5
Perfect. 

Speaker 7
What are you doing, Henry? 

Speaker 2
I can't see it. If you can, it's not like showing up for me. 

Speaker 1
Should I have screen? 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 1 second orga. There's a couple of things I want to. If you go to the. 

Speaker 4
Untitled base. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, okay, got you. 

Speaker 4
Just name it. 

Speaker 5
Something we'll go with that. We can do. 

Speaker 2
Kind of like prompt. 

Speaker 5
Date agent, something like that. And we'll go from there. 

Speaker 2
Email copy email. 

Speaker 3
I think we should get a reasoning maybe not all now, but like for later you can just note it down. Not all connecting immediately, just emails, but later we should get also reasoning and maybe the icebreakers. 

Speaker 2
So kind of like. 

Speaker 3
I think prompt and agent will be the same thing basically. So you can just use one. We know which prompt would go to which agent, I guess. Or maybe actually so I will. 

Speaker 5
Here. 

Speaker 2
Bartek, what's your email? 

Speaker 3
Bartek Tomashevsky. 

Speaker 2
Let me get this wrong. 

Speaker 3
After s is that s? Yeah. W key w ski. That's correct@celebrities.com. 

Speaker 5
Okay cool. 

Speaker 3
And I have also one thing I wanted to say. I'm thinking to introduce one of the juniors from silver to this project if you guys want to have more people on board. And I'm thinking if he could join the fast rides like be the deaf here, that's okay because I'm not having much time to actually train my junior and he is just waiting for a project currently. 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 2
Well yeah, let's meet him maybe on Wednesday's dev meeting. 

Speaker 3
Yes, actually he have time on Wednesday so I will arrange that. 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 3
And one more thing. I'm throwing the upwork automation in the chat so you guys can check it out later. We can inspire from it and maybe make something more than this guy make. Just make something on make. I think we can connect it with this identity system we got here. But this make automation will be for getting the jobs that match our criteria and then we will send those jobs to this agent system to write the proposal, let's say. 

Speaker 2
Okay, yeah, that's fantastic. Okay. This is great because this is what I was hoping for. The knowledge base about who we are is the same and it's great. 

Speaker 3
I'm actually using knowledge base from my upwork profile to write the proposals currently. 

Speaker 2
That's great. 

Speaker 3
I'm just saying like load bio knowledge base and then make proposal for this job offer. And I'm just pasting the text currently, but we can definitely get that automated. And I think that the most tedious thing is looking at those upwork jobs as they appear and you got to be fast. You better be in the first hour there with your proposal. So I think that's best thing to automate because for me it's tiring to even look like scrolling. 1 hour these jobs. I don't know how much you're trying to get there. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I hear you. 

Speaker 5
Okay, sounds good. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, that's cool. There is another thing, Bartek, which is the knowledge based system. I'd like to dig into the ideas you had with Powell around what that system might look like for you guys. What the initial thoughts you had around sort of living breathing knowledge base. And I talked obviously about the zoom to transcript automation system and how do we level that up. And I feel like your skills will be greatly put to use in that project. So let's reconnect maybe later today and talk more about that. So I want to see where your headset and how you visualize it and how we match visions with this. 

Speaker 3
There's definitely some ideas for that. I wasn't really talking about this with Pavo. Like we don't figure out how we want to make our knowledge base for celebrities, more of coming up with ideas, how we could use that rather than how we're going to make it. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, it's easier. It's easier to come up with ideas of what you wish you had than actually doing foundation. 

Speaker 3
But definitely I've been also thinking about, I don't want to just make storm of ideas in here like too much because if there's too much ideas at one meeting then there is not going to be executed next time. But as you're asking about this, I've been thinking about making together GPTs that would be making the knowledge base structure. So that would be like a proof of concept for maybe average prompt or agent or whatever that we could add to this knowledge base transcript system. And it would not only get the transcript into the knowledge base, but also it would make a structure like for example markdown or something like that. 

Speaker 2
Right. 

Speaker 3
Probably increase readability on the other side for sure. That's one thing regarding the meeting. I cannot make it today, maybe tomorrow or after, whatever. I'm just changing my schedule so I'll be about 1 hour because I've been the night person so much now. I'm changing the sleep schedule. Sabbath more available in the morning hours now. And hopefully working like a normal person, not only in the night. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, sounds good brother. I used a series of GPTs to create this and then I printed it, which is the knowledge base and it reads kind of nicely there's still work to be done, but very happy with the current results, has all our tools, what we've worked on, what we want to work on, our types of the industries that we want to tackle, et cetera. 

Speaker 3
Nice. Can you send me a file so I'll check it out tomorrow? 

Speaker 2
Yes, I will tag you on the post on discord. And what else? Oh, yeah. Kuba, would you share one more time the Google Colab so we can show Yorg? 

Speaker 6
Okay. All right. 

Speaker 2
So we've been working on a very interesting system for automating outreach. And in this system we want to leverage a few things. Number one, obviously the incredible abilities of GBD. 

Speaker 5
Four. 

Speaker 2
Number two, prompt engineering, particularly Bartex PFA for creating elaborate prompts from a simple one. And you'll see some examples of that. Number three, our targets LinkedIn profiles and recent posts, et cetera. So their LinkedIn profile. Number four, a sequence of agents which will, as Kuba is about to show you, which will take the information for the profile, find the things that are useful, create an email, and then critique that email to do a final version of the email. What useful means is always relative to who we are and who we want to target, what we are selling. So the fifth sort of utility tool that we have is a knowledge base that we created last week about faster ICE. So we're going to be leveraging all those things, create these emails to start sending mass emails to. 

Speaker 2
And your help is going to be huge for identifying good emails from bad emails and figuring out what framework are we going to use for these emails. So it's going to be very much a human machine, human kind of project. If you can, go ahead. 

Speaker 6
Yeah, I'm sharing my screen now. Can I see? 

Speaker 5
Yes. 

Speaker 6
So this is the first prompt for extracting from the LinkedIn profile. Okay. Yeah, you should answer only. 

Speaker 3
Sorry, guys, because I need to go soon. I don't want to stop you if you want to go over this holding now, but I'm going to have to do like five more minutes. We can just jump into the PFA and try to upgrade this prompt live. 

Speaker 2
You know what? Let's do this. I'll send you the link and if you can start looking at it, Bartek, that'd be great. So York can see this and then we can all pitch into with ideas. 

Speaker 3
All right, so I'll just run it in the PFA and I will probably share you the chat because I will have to bounce in like eight minutes. 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 2
Yep, yep, sounds good. I'm sharing the link to the colab on the chat, right? 

Speaker 3
All right. 

Speaker 5
Okay, cool. 

Speaker 2
Okay, yeah, go ahead, Rukuba. 

Speaker 6
Sorry about the noise. So first of all, this class is to extract the LinkedIn URL of the client from a Google search. So this is the tool I created for the agent to use. So this is like initializing the agent. So this is the prompts for the agent, and the prompt says, your answer should contain a profile URL link. I give it the two and I give it the format. This is also for initializing the agent. So when I input the name of the person, like the name of the client I'm looking for, this is the chief scientist about meta. So you search Google and only extracts the LinkedIn URL of your lacoun. So using LinkedIn URL, I run it through proxy call to script and cruise data off LinkedIn. And this is the result here that. 

Speaker 7
Works for anyone or just for many people that are well known. 

Speaker 6
So what did you say? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, that should work for anyone. 

Speaker 6
Just anyone? Yes. So this is the result of Yalakunda script using proxy core. 

Speaker 7
Yeah, that sounds awesome. Honestly, it could save so much time. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 6
So this is just like formatting based on the information I extracted. I'm calling a class. This is an output password to format Yalaku's full name introduction about. I'm using GPT to know format the information I got into. Full name of Yalakun introduction about him, project, his experience and topic of interest based on the information I script on LinkedIn. Then this is the prompt for it. And this is the output that I brought back. Then from this is the next page, which is like loading pastorized knowledge into event. So this is another two I created. So these two is just like based on the information I script about Yalakun. Now I'm going to qualify if Yalakun is qualified to work with fast price. This is what the agent is doing. So this is the prompt of the agent based on the information. 

Speaker 2
Can we look at that prompt real quick? 

Speaker 6
Okay, so this is it. 

Speaker 5
Rate. 

Speaker 2
This is for lead qualification. 

Speaker 5
You. 

Speaker 6
Relevant analysts matchmaker with deep understanding of artificial intelligence and AI sector. So based on the industry we are going to work on, so we refine the prompt. So for qualifying the lead must be relevant to the industry we're working with. Do you understand? If we're working with the ski shell industry, we can just refine our prompt to really accept clients that are related to ski shell industry. But for now, because I just did like an AI sector. Do you understand? 

Speaker 7
Yeah, I do understand. It's pretty complicated, but it just seems really good. Can actually help us on the outreach. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 6
So this is the final answer. Yalakun is highly significant individual in the AI sector. Will be a valuable asset to our company in advancing our solutions. So this is just like qualifying the lead. So this prompt is just like for summarizing our password node. Bees. So this next one is just like for the icebreaker. Based on information I have about Kun, I need to create an icebreaker. This is the prompt for jazz breaker. 

Speaker 2
So those icebreakers are essentially going to be the first line of the email, and we're going to write the rest of the email based on these icebreakers. 

Speaker 7
One approach, basically, it writes an email automatically depending on the information about him. Is that right? 

Speaker 2
Right. 

Speaker 7
Okay. 

Speaker 2
And the information about us? 

Speaker 7
Yeah, of course. 

Speaker 6
These two is just like, to draft the email. So this is the prompts for drafting the email. You're a copywriter. Your role is to craft engaging and personalized and email like outro email that aligns with both a recipient profile information and our company's objective. That's fast, right? To start the introduction of email and information we have about our company development. So this is just like, I'm just giving it information I have about Yala Kon, then password. And I'm telling you to craft out the email. So this was the result. 

Speaker 2
Take a second York to read that and you'll have your criticism. But that's the first draft of the email it's written. 

Speaker 7
How can I create. So this was created with this code, right? This email, correct? 

Speaker 2
With everything you saw so far? 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 7
So I always. I personally think that wouldn't work, even though it's actually great, the concept and all that, it's actually great. What I would do with this tool, in my opinion, what I would do is I just gather the information and then craft the email myself, or just with a sort of structured template email to create the email. Because here, as you know, for me, I know that this is pretty much AI generated and not many people will like to receive this kind of email. So what I would do is to simplify all this and just have sort of a structure of the email where then you can then add this human touch yourself. 

Speaker 6
So what I'm thinking now is we could do few short prompting. If you can craft out templates that we can use, like two or three, and we can train the AI on human templates for you to follow. So to understand, okay, this is how I'm supposed to talk. This is how I'm supposed to drop out the email. Do you understand? I think it will bring out better output. Sorry. 

Speaker 7
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
I think we're on the same page regarding, number one, the quality, how effective this email would be, which is not very effective in obviously getting answer right. I think you run to something with needing structure, needing a structure to follow. What would that structure be? So what we're thinking is, let's start with the overarching. Let's start with the framework. And which framework would we want to use? Whose framework would we want to use for the structure of the. And the two that come to mind. The only two that come to mind are Alex Formosi or NicOs. Very simple, straightforward, understandable. This is the framework of the email. And after we can get a few. We're going to do some improvements to this. 

Speaker 2
And after we can get a few emails that you and I say, hey, these actually are definitely going in the right direction, or these icebreakers work really well, or we create our own. 

Speaker 6
Then. 

Speaker 2
We can go back to the step and say, hey, here's the framework we use, and here are some examples of the email and why they're effective. From that we can say, hey, write the whole email without the icebreaker, and we make the icebreaker write the whole email, but I'll write the call to action. And we write the call to action from there. We have a lot more flexibility. We can do it however we want to do it. And I very much think like it's opportunity to go parallel on human and parallel on fully generated. For now, we need to come up with two things. Number one, the framework that we want to use, and we want to guide the GPT to follow. So what's the framework for writing the email? 

Speaker 2
And number two, looking into what are all the, say, critical factors, what really are we offering? Is the question here, what is our offer? Why are we sending this email? And we need to make that crystal clear. It might be that we are sort of initially talking about a consultation to find out how they could use it, or it might be more straightforward. It's like, hey, we built this system. We built an outreach system. We built automated listing finder for real estate agents that sends SMS automatically. Whatever that product is. How do we mix it into the email? So let's take some time to figure that out. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 6
Okay. 

Speaker 7
So you want the structure, let's. 

Speaker 2
Let devs go do their thing and continue working on their stuff. And let's stay here, you and I, and we can look into it. 

Speaker 7
Yeah, but for the email campaign, I think we should launch it as soon as possible. When do you think, could we do that? Because you have the emails ready and all that. 

Speaker 2
Yes. Well, we can do that right now. I don't see why not. 

Speaker 7
I think for me that's more important because we have to start to keep outreaching and trying to get clients rather than trying new outreach methods. Because this one, we said we're going to do it, but we actually didn't yet, and we don't know if it works or not. So the thing here, we just have to test out and see how that works out. 

Speaker 2
Yes, absolutely. So let's set up the email campaign right now. 

Speaker 7
Okay, perfect. 

Speaker 2
Kuba Bartek. Henry, what clarity or questions do you have? 

Speaker 4
I don't have any questions about this project, but I do want to finish up what were doing at the start of the call. 

Speaker 2
Yes. 

Speaker 3
Can you guys look into the promise factory channel on Discord? Yeah, I could see that draft of the framework. It could look something like this. 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 2
I like that format. And we will tweak it a little bit. Could you copy paste the. Oh, you copied chat? 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 2
I think that's very straightforward. 

Speaker 5
So that's cool. 

Speaker 3
Also, the whole prompt is on the repo because it's kind of got. 

Speaker 5
Out. 

Speaker 3
Of context of the answer of the code window in PFA. So you can get it from the repo. I just copied it in a correct manner because if the output is too long, it just goes out of the code box. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
Cool. 1 second I'm reading this. Okay, let's do this. 

Speaker 2
Jorg, could you please pull up a framework that you have been using or feel comfortable about using anything that you can walk me through quickly so we align on what framework we want to use for the writing the emails. 

Speaker 7
Didn't we create the framework when were making the emails on the note? Let me see if I can find it. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I got to go check out the upwork thing. Let's talk Wednesday about that and keep it posted on the table so I could maybe help how to set up the headers of testing so we could only go over the code again tomorrow in the morning of this whole system, and I will note down some things that we should consider taking out of there into their table for proper testing. 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, good call. And let's connect, you and I, tomorrow to talk about the knowledge base, about the builder. Knowledge base builder. 

Speaker 3
Yep, definitely shoot me your hours and I will choose. 

Speaker 5
Cool, cool. 

Speaker 3
All right, awesome. 

Speaker 2
See ya, guys. See ya. Henry, you want to share screen real quick and sort that config stuff out. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, sure. 

Speaker 6
All right, guys, I'll check. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. So changing to GBD for turbo and knowledge base, those are priorities. 

Speaker 6
All right, cool. 

Speaker 2
Awesome. Thank you, Guba. Great work, brother. 

Speaker 6
Bye, guys. 

Speaker 5
See ya. 

Speaker 2
Okay, so we go back to terminal. Okay, awesome. So we're looking at, it says, os environment. Get Kaggle config directory. When you're in here, you're going to need to use the arrow keys, looking. 

Speaker 4
All the way down again. 

Speaker 2
Okay, that's good because that has where it's looking for the file versus where it should be. 

Speaker 5
Looking for the file. 

Speaker 2
Up a little bit. See where it says config directory? Config there. 

Speaker 4
Oh, yeah. 

Speaker 2
And config file, that's where it's looking. So we can't find anything. 

Speaker 5
And now it's saying config values, warning, make directories, span user. And then it's looking for Kaggle. 

Speaker 2
And can you show me where you wrote where you created that directory? Because you created a directory that was called period Kaggle. You created a directory that was called Kaggle somewhere. 

Speaker 5
Maybe it's in the terminal, maybe it. 

Speaker 2
Was in the Jupiter notebook. 

Speaker 4
Kaggle API. 

Speaker 2
And then go up more. 

Speaker 5
Okay, so not there. 

Speaker 2
Go to your terminal and scroll up. Yeah. Okay. At the very beginning, make directory. Squigglyline Kaggle. At the very top. Yes. 

Speaker 4
I moved it to this directory. That's not make, that's move, but right. 

Speaker 2
On top of that, you made it. 

Speaker 4
Oh, that's make, I had no idea what that was. 

Speaker 2
Okay, yeah, that's make directory. And then you change the permission access to 600. That was on purpose. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
Okay, cool. 

Speaker 2
This is what we're going to do. Scroll down and we're going to say. 

Speaker 5
Within that, within that kaggle Json, you. 

Speaker 2
See where it says Os environment, os path join. 

Speaker 4
Oh, yeah, I see that. Yeah, OS environment. 

Speaker 2
Okay, before that it says or something else. So with the arrow keys, you're going to go to that point and delete it. Delete that first part before Os path. Yes, we're going to delete all of that. 

Speaker 4
So I'm deleting the right thing. 

Speaker 2
Just keep going. Okay, cool. And now we are going to save this. 

Speaker 4
Okay. 

Speaker 2
By saying control o. 

Speaker 5
Or command O. 

Speaker 2
Control o. Maybe it's okay, cancel it's function. Control o. 

Speaker 4
I've got a weird. 

Speaker 2
Oh shit, I deleted it. Yeah, just do an equal. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, but I can't type it. 

Speaker 5
That's funny. 

Speaker 2
Okay, I'm just going to take control of your computer for a second. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. You realize you could probably delete everything yeah, I know. This is ultimate trial. 

Speaker 2
Not today. Not today. File name, right? Yes. And now we go. And now we go. This might not work yet. 

Speaker 4
Missing username. Yeah, it's the same error. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
Where is control? 

Speaker 2
W where is. 

Speaker 5
Load? Big. 

Speaker 2
There we go. 

Speaker 5
So load config, but give me the next one. Self load config. Where are you? Where are you? Okay, let's see. 

Speaker 2
Load config, final step of the authenticate steps where we load the values from config data into the configuration object. Config data dictionary with configuration values. 

Speaker 5
Keys to read into self config values. 

Speaker 2
Username and password require config name user config name key. 

Speaker 5
Where do these come from then? 

Speaker 4
Config name user and config name key are the two items in the jSon. 

Speaker 2
But when are these being loaded? 

Speaker 5
Let's see. 

Speaker 1
That's the API extended. 

Speaker 4
I'm kind of surprised that it even goes to this folder because I thought the directory was just something. Not API, kaggle, something. 

Speaker 5
Whoa. Okay. Select self it config value. Self config name. Where the fuck are you, man? Self config name user. 

Speaker 4
You're still taking control of my screen? 

Speaker 5
Yeah. Cool. Okay, that's fine because I can do like this. 

Speaker 4
Did you do a lot of this kind of stuff at Nike or not? 

Speaker 2
Oh God, no. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, I'm so glad I didn't. Where are you that, okay. 

Speaker 2
Reconfig file. 

Speaker 5
Yes. 

Speaker 2
Since we can get the username. 

Speaker 5
And password from the environment. How? 

Speaker 4
That's the second method where you save it to the environment. There's two methods. You can do it. You can either do it where you have it in the environment and you go, here's the username and password, and you export it and save it in the environment, or you use the API or you use the json file. Does that make this extend? Maybe this whole API extended is the extended version. So the second version where you're using it in the environment. 

Speaker 2
Yes, that would make sense. 

Speaker 5
That would certainly make sense. 

Speaker 2
But something not really. 

Speaker 4
I don't get how we're in this file because if you go to the very top. No, you can just scroll up. You don't need to do the arrows like up here. What did I do? Yeah, when I moved the file, I just moved it to Kaggle, Kaggle jSon. I didn't even mention this API extended until later. I don't know. Does that make sense? Like, I'm looking at this line here. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, right. 

Speaker 5
Okay, let me try something. If I go X and I go nano and if this doesn't work, then I'm going to step away and I'll let you play with Chaijibit. 

Speaker 2
This is empty. No, wait, I messed up. Well, this should be where you're doing it. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, I opened in a text file earlier and it worked. That would make sense if it's empty. If you go nano and then let's type in there, I can give you the exact stuff. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, let's do it. 

Speaker 4
Because from 3 hours ago, this was it. There you go. 

Speaker 5
Cool. 

Speaker 6
So weird. 

Speaker 4
It's empty. I don't know how it's become empty. I originally thought, okay, it must be empty then. So then I opened the file in text editor and it said the same stuff. 

Speaker 5
File name to write. Open file for writing. What the fuck does that mean? 

Speaker 4
I could redownload the file and we could start from the get go. 

Speaker 2
Well, we don't really need to do that. We can say, hey, echo. 

Speaker 5
No, not that. We don't need to do that. We can say, hey, one sec, echo this into here. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, it's a directory. How the fuck does that work? What do you mean? 

Speaker 5
So strange. 

Speaker 4
It's there, but it's meant to be in this list, isn't it? Right? 

Speaker 2
Wait, give me a second. Okay. I know, lsaot. I know. Why is this a directory? That's so weird. How is this a directory? 

Speaker 4
I may have done something, I don't know. 

Speaker 2
Oh, that's fucking funny. Wait, no, because just a file. No, we're like super close to fix this. This is a directory so I can remove there. 

Speaker 5
And remove. 

Speaker 2
Oh my God, how does this even work? Whoa, what happened? Oh, this is where you moved everything. Oh my God, we figured it out. That's so funny. Oh my God, that's so funny. So we're going to go back. 

Speaker 4
Also, can you do me a favor? I didn't know how to get to, I wanted to remove everything from this file because when I was speaking to Chad GPT, it was so funny, my conversation with Chad GPT. In fact, let me show you. 

Speaker 2
I don't have time because waiting. I don't want to make him wait anymore. But I'm going to let you, director, I'm going to let you. 

Speaker 5
Move this to this, right? This is how you do it. You move one thing, you move it to that. 

Speaker 2
And now directories is where you have all of these. Now I'm going to create a file. 

Speaker 5
There we go. 

Speaker 2
Now I'm going to create a file called Kaggle JSon with that information in. 

Speaker 5
It. 

Speaker 1
Because if they're put back, they can be. 

Speaker 2
Sorry. Say that again. 

Speaker 4
You know all the Jupyter notebook, the WGet, all those stuff in the terminal? Yeah, I want to delete it because I had to reinstall and chat. GPT was like, because I sent everything there. It's very risky and I'll probably get errors if I just move it right back. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, that sounds about right. 

Speaker 1
Or is that all just X? 

Speaker 2
Well, you'd want to do it the right way. 

Speaker 4
You need quotes around username. Thank you. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, I thought there was something off here. 

Speaker 4
Single quote. 

Speaker 2
It'S the same, right? Oh, I can just copy that. 

Speaker 5
Never mind, because I tried doing it the other way and it didn't quite work. 

Speaker 2
And I need. 

Speaker 4
Demo rag. 

Speaker 2
You shut the fuck up. Oh my God. Let's go. 

Speaker 4
That's weird. Can you do CMOd 600? I think you need to redo that again. 

Speaker 2
Why? 

Speaker 4
Because look, your kaggle API key is readable by other users on the system. 

Speaker 2
Oh, you're fine, but sure. 

Speaker 4
Also, what do I do about, I was kind of lost when I was following you when all those files showed up. 

Speaker 2
So it kept saying, you can't do this because Kaggle JSon is a directory. I'm like, what the fuck do you mean it ends in a JSOn? Well, directories apparently don't have very weird naming conventions, so you can put an extension on a directory. So what happened? I realized Kaggle JSon is the directory. I tried reading into the directory and all of this showed up. So I kept trying to save a file with words in it and it's like, no, you can't, this is a directory. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, I see. Have we deleted this directory? And I'll have to piv install everything again. 

Speaker 5
Right. 

Speaker 2
We renamed it to directories. I'm going to actually do you a favor and move all of this into old directories and you're going to have a copy of everything. You're going to have that in your base directory. So if you go home, which is. 

Speaker 5
This is how you do it now. 

Speaker 2
You'Ll be able to see old directories in there somewhere. 

Speaker 5
Old directories, home. 

Speaker 4
I do. 

Speaker 2
Ls for home. You do this, you do CD, squiggly line. Squiggly line. 

Speaker 4
Okay, how do I get to root at Henry's MacBook air? Because that's something that was also interesting that you did. 

Speaker 2
Oh, you get here proper root. You go CD and then again CD, and now you're in root. This is the shit you don't want to mess with. This is the shit you usually can't mess with unless you're in. 

Speaker 4
Like if I made a new terminal now, it doesn't start with root at Henry's MacBook fair. It starts with like Henry Allen at mail. 

Speaker 5
Yep. 

Speaker 2
Because you go CD squiggly line. Right. Because went into super user. Remember we said pseudo s and that gives you like admin power in your own computer. And now it changed to root. 

Speaker 4
Okay, got it. 

Speaker 2
So I'm glad it works. I hope it doesn't get stuck soon. And good luck with the rag. 

Speaker 4
I've been working on that sort of lesson thing whilst I've got my screen on. 

Speaker 2
Well, we're going to need it for proper pull out. For proper pull out? 

Speaker 4
Yeah. These images are my favorite. 

Speaker 2
I love that. Did you check out that resource I shared for. Oh yeah, you should definitely check that out. There's gold in there. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, I'll check it out again. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, this one. 

Speaker 4
All right. I'll let you help york out then. 

Speaker 5
Cool. 

Speaker 4
All right, see you, man. 

Speaker 5
Peace. Okay. 

Speaker 2
I'm going to send you a link and. Oh, I sent it already. If you jump on there, we can go over the prompts together. Or actually let's start the other way around. Let's start with me sharing screen. 

Speaker 5
And we're going to go over some of these. 

Speaker 2
Some of the points because you had something to share is simply looking at what is the framework that we want to follow and give guidance on what. 

Speaker 7
That framework is and keeping it. We are first going to do the. 

Speaker 2
Oh, that's right. Let's finish the campaign. Sorry about that. 

Speaker 7
Yeah, okay. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, you're right. So campaigns that we started were this, you can call it a failure, whatever you want. There were no replies. The open rate wasn't bad. Started around 50 something. Anyway. 

Speaker 7
So you sent it already. 

Speaker 2
These are. 

Speaker 7
I can see you have to change. 

Speaker 2
You can't see my screen. Got you. So this is an old campaign that we had done because we needed to start and was a bit of a test campaign. So I thought we had sent 300, I think. Yeah, we had sent 300. A bunch bounced. It wasn't a grade list. It wasn't supposed really to make any sales. It was more for us to be. 

Speaker 5
Able to. 

Speaker 2
Start getting used to instantly. I think I showed you these, I showed you the sequences that we did and. Yeah, that's about it. 

Speaker 7
Okay. Didn't we go over it last time? I think went over it, yes. 

Speaker 2
We did go over it last night. Last time. 

Speaker 7
So we just have to set up everything. We are ready. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. Do you want to do it as a follow up? Do you want to do it as a different campaign with same email list? Or do you want to do different email lists altogether? 

Speaker 7
Wait, I don't understand. What do you mean? 

Speaker 2
So there are 300 contacts here, right? Nobody really responded. So you said you had emails ready? 

Speaker 7
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
So do you want to do it as a follow up to these emails? 

Speaker 7
Okay. It depends on how good quality do you think those prospects are? 

Speaker 2
Very bad. 

Speaker 7
Then here's my answer. I don't think for purpose of trying to get a client. Why should we be mediocre? Let's go for the best ones because. 

Speaker 2
Of the purpose of time. So how much time do we have in finding those email? So I have some shortcuts that we can do to get a new email list. Your emails are for vacation rentals? Yeah. 

Speaker 7
Mainly. 

Speaker 5
Okay, cool. 

Speaker 7
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
Okay, let's sort this out. 

Speaker 2
Would you walk me through some of the emails? 

Speaker 7
Okay, let me see. It's been a long time. 

Speaker 2
They're the ones you shared on discord. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 7
So there's the first one. Wait 2 seconds. So as we know, we need the hook. The headline. The headline is I can't believe I'm doing this. Or you can have some variations like I can't believe I'm doing this for you for name something that catches your attention. I don't know. For me that's something that would catch my attention and I would click. But of course we must AP test and have different subject lines. 

Speaker 2
I agree. 

Speaker 7
Do you have the email before you or do you want me to share my screen? 

Speaker 2
Could you share screen? 

Speaker 7
Yeah, sure. 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 6
Here. 

Speaker 7
Can you see? 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
Okay, perfect. 

Speaker 7
So yeah, the headline, as I said, I can't believe I'm doing this. Another one was something like, okay, I have it on my email. 

Speaker 2
You could copy paste this into a new instantly campaign. So if you want to do like a final edit or something like that. 

Speaker 5
That works for me. 

Speaker 7
Wait, is it already on the instantly? 

Speaker 2
These emails are not, but they're extremely easy to add. 

Speaker 6
Yeah. 

Speaker 7
If you want me to add them myself. Whatever you want. Yeah. 

Speaker 2
I'd love for you to take full charge of the following email campaigns. I think you're totally ready to sort of lead the charge. I'll help you with getting the leads that you need, but sequences, subsequences, scheduling, all that stuff. I want to see you shine, brother. So I'm giving you full control. If you want advice, obviously I'm here so I'm listening. 

Speaker 6
Yeah. 

Speaker 7
Okay, perfect. So the other one that I told you. Is this one. Would you believe this name? It's more personalized, but of course, we can have many different headlines and we should test which ones. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. Anyway, I agree. 

Speaker 7
Yeah. So into the core of the email. So, hey, name.
