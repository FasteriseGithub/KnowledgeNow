What got you excited about AI in the first place? What motivated setting up your AI automation agency initially? How did the formation of the fast track team happen? What key skills does each person in the team have? What were the initial challenges you faced when starting fastrise and how you overcame them? What is your company ethos and mission? How has fastrise evolved since its inception in terms of services, technology, and market focus? What industries is Faster ICE currently focusing on, what solutions have we built so far, and what tangible value do they provide? How do we ensure privacy? What are future goals for faster rights, and how do you plan and achieve them? How do you see the role of AI in society evolving, and what part does Fast Rights play in the future?

Speaker 2
For me, it was way back in 2022 November when chat GPT came out, and then I was able to do my homework so much faster. So because of that, I sort of was drawn to the tool and I could suddenly be top of my class without hard work. But it also taught me a lot.

Speaker 3
I don't know if I can pinpoint the exact kind of time or the exact thing that got me really excited about it. It was around 2022. Me and some friends were on a Zoom call, and were just kind of messing with it to see what it knew. And there was an island off the coast of South America that had the same name as an island in Long Island, and GPT had no idea about the one in South America. Everything was related to the one in the US. We even gave it prompts about the island, but it didnâ€™t know. We ended up going from GPT to Bing's version, and Bing knew about it, but GPT didn't. It was just fascinating to know one knowledge base has some information and another one has better information.

Speaker 4
I initially rejected AI because it's terrifying and I care a lot about people. The first thing that my mind goes to is taking people's jobs and big companies getting involved, money getting involved, greed getting involved, and everyone leaving ethics and human behind. Now, I need to be a part of this to ensure that ethics and people don't get left behind. And coming from education, of course, the first wave of media around chat GPT are students are going to cheat. And then thinking about how we can use AI to enhance critical thinking or develop skills that aren't being learned in schools. Being in education and also seeing the gaps of where education is and where it needs to be, wanting to be a part of bringing AI into it in a productive way, and seeing the access that opens up access to learning, access to knowledge, access to being able to do whatever you want to do.

Speaker 1
For me, it was between 2017 and 2018 when I started learning about how AI could now play video games and be world champions at their own games. That was a light bulb moment for me. In 2017, it was reinforcement learning that caught my attention. I realized the depth that this field had, compared to other fields I was interested in like finance trading and computer science, which seemed a bit monotonous. AI integrates all these cool things that I like, from video games to programming into building actual things, and it completely blew my mind.

Speaker 2
So, I've had two agencies. Whilst I was in college, I realized that university wasn't going to be for me. I learned a lot more on my own, and I wanted some way to find financial freedom, location freedom, and time freedom. So I started a marketing company, and I got my first client through a work placement at college. Around the same time, I was also playing around with AI. I found marketing quite monotonous and not that exciting. So when I was leaving college, I decided the best way to learn was by doing. That's where I started my own AI agency, and then one month into that, I found you guys, and we sort of all got talking and started this up.

Speaker 1
In August of 2023, I came across a two-hour video about starting your own AI agency, and it was very encouraging. There was depth, not just an eight-minute talk about AI. It was immediate for me because Liam showed a framework that anyone can follow. I joined the community, and I talked to a friend of mine about it. When I talked to Paige about it, she was very interested and her brain just started going. And something that resonated was travel agencies, though first, we thought of vegan restaurants. We realized that maybe the restaurant industry isn't quite where the money is right now, and we went through several iterations of ideas since then.Speaker 3
I think it's interesting that you started with the restaurant industry. What about the restaurant industry? Got your attention and then specifically vegan restaurants from there. 

Speaker 1
How hard it is for someone who, with strict dietary restrictions, to find something that they actually want and finding the right place, or a variety of options, like being able to sit down, opening the menu, knowing that there's going to be several options there. Right. 

Speaker 3
You won't be limited from the selection. 

Speaker 4
I see, right. And then we started thinking about, for example, Alejo's brother, who is on the very far end of the carnivore spectrum, and his partner, who is very strict vegan of like, oh, what about partners or families that need to find a restaurant that can accommodate everything? Because there are a lot of times where Alejo's brother is no interest whatsoever in going to a vegan restaurant. He won't go there. And that's just create, they're not the only ones. Right. So how to assist people in finding restaurants that have everything that they want. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I think that's a problem all over the world. And we haven't spoken about this before, but I was in Oxford on Monday, and I was with my sister and my sister's vegetarian, and she's very picky about what she eats. And we had a scenario where she spent ages trying to find a place and we're like, oh, Charlote, please hurry up. I just want to eat. And she's found this place. But then we get there and it's closed, or we find another place and we're like, oh, this place does a vegetarian. But the options aren't quite right. So that's an experience I've been in as well, so very cool. 

Speaker 1
It's a very real experience. So if you could just chat with a restaurant on Instagram and they actually responded, this would just not be a headache. We realized, well, who is the customer and why? And that's where it started getting tricky, especially with a low margin that restaurants run. So that's when the idea started being less feasible. And then we stepped into travel agencies, because it's like, hey, we're both passionate about this and we know very little about what being a travel agent really is, but there has to be something here. And a month later, the GPT come out faster. ICE had already started, right? So we had stepped away from that, but GPT's come out, and the example that Sam Altman shows on stage is booking a trip. 

Speaker 1
And were like, oh, man, we're so glad that we just stepped away right at the right time, or maybe the exact wrong time, right? Because again, now, four months after GPT's come out, they give a two session chat, GPT lessons, conference talk, and they didn't even step into GPT. They didn't even talk about GPT and probably accurately, so maybe they shouldn't have. But anyway, it's been growing and that's how our agency evolved. But how did faster ICE come about, you all? Henry, what do you remember? How did that come about? Late October? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, late October. So I just turned 19 and I was like, right, I needed to sort something out, so I was like, what's the best thing I can do? And it was talk to people in the space because all my mates had gone to uni. I realized I'm going to lose motivation if I'm not talking to people doing the same thing as me. So I started hopping in the Discord channels and talking to people and meeting people. And then we all kind of collectively ideated the idea of a lead magnet. They're bringing leads to all of our agencies. And then that carried on for about a month and were working on that. And then some things changed. 

Speaker 2
Some people had different commitments and what tended to happen and what we saw was some of us were quite full time with the project and some weren't. I think Alejand Page, you can definitely remember being very full time with that. And then I guess we also saw we shedded a lot of skin and we evolved into not doing the lead magnet and becoming faster eyes. And, yeah, it's all been numerous projects since then, and those are great ideas and we're definitely brewing something. And I'm just ready. I feel like we're right around the corner from hitting it big. 

Speaker 1
What do you remember about the initial creation and the transition into becoming faster? 

Speaker 4
It was a bit chaotic. I just remember suddenly getting sucked into voice channels on discord and realizing that 4 hours would go by and I didn't even know what we're talking about anymore. But in this space, people were showcasing really cool AI tools that I'd never heard about. That was the first time that I heard about voice dialers that sounded legit, because up until then, the idea of an AI voice dialer was based on my association of what they are now, which are what Zach said on the last call. They're not going to be able to help solve my problem. It's just another annoying barrier that I have to get through. Until this one guy invited a bot into our conversation. And if I hadn't known ahead of time, I would have thought it was real. 

Speaker 4
Just the mannerisms, the way that it spoke added some human components, like, oh, sorry, I was on mute. It wasn't on mute. Yeah, it was crazy. And then I think what we learned a lot of is just the challenges of getting a big group of people all on the same page, coming from all different industries, trying to figure out a common thread of a niche that works. And ended up pivoting away from the lead magnet, in part because we split from the guy that ideated the lead magnet and he went on forth with it and we decided, you know what? We're here together. We realized that we're going to go farther together. We all want the same thing. We all have our own agency, and we can do bigger things together. So we've got something good going. 

Speaker 4
Let's stick it out, let's see what happens. And over time, we've definitely grown smaller, but I'd say we've increased. The quality of people that we have on our team is so high, and that's a beautiful thing. Small but mighty at this point. 

Speaker 1
And the transition from the initial 25, 30 people to our current less than ten, discouraging at first, because it's like, oh, why isn't everybody just like, in the same excitement as they were in week one? And that's just something that happens. But the amount of the overhead that we had, the amount of time that we had to spend organizing, reorganizing, talking, asking, waiting and waiting, where a lot of the people just fell off and who was left were the titans. Who was left were the ones that's like, wait, I know there's something here. And it deserved a good chunk of my time and my attention and my effort. And I think a big part of that has been the people, has been the small but type community, and. And it. Sorry. 

Speaker 1
It's allowed us to have USAC, for example, come in, and what we thought was what we had going for us, which was a room of 25 people showing to a gen xec. Actually, what we had going for us is the few that were engaged and were ready to blow this out of the park. So somebody, another titan like you, Zach, comes along, and it's like, oh, okay, there's something valuable. 

Speaker 3
So I definitely saw that. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
I wanted to hear real quick what Paige wanted to add. 

Speaker 4
One thing is, it was interesting early on when we had, I would say, about 20 people, and were voting on a lot of things. And one of the questions that we put out there was, what is your main intention for being here? And there were some people who were a part of that group who were straight up, and they were like, I'm here for money. This is what I'm here. I want to make money. And then there were a lot of other people who wrote, no, I'm here to learn. I'm here to grow. I'm here to network. I'm here to build new skills. And that very much informed the mission and the culture of the organization. And the people that were only here for money dropped off. 

Speaker 4
Obviously, we're all here to make money, and I think there's better alignment of the people that are here. It felt like sort of a natural, you know what? If the alignment isn't there, then it's just not there. We can't force a square hole into a round one. Right. But when we have the alignment, we can move forward on a strong foundation of culture. And the thought that I actually just had now was when we voted on the name of the company, there were probably 2025 people, and I'm wondering if any of us here actually voted for faster eyes. 

Speaker 1
I did. 

Speaker 4
Okay. I think it was one of my three, but because we had probably about ten different name options and we voted, and were sending out Google forms and surveys probably two or three times a week to try to streamline the voting process, because it was important to us to ensure that everyone had a voice, and it was important that we don't set up a structure where there are executives at the top making all the money, and the people who are actually doing the work aren't getting compensated or valued. Obviously, leadership is important, and good leadership is important. And the sort of metaphor model example comes into mind of the best engineer isn't the best manager, but the best engineer typically gets promoted to be the manager because it's a paid promotion you get. 

Speaker 4
But then that best engineer no longer is actually doing what they do best. They're managing people, which is probably not what they do best. And there was a lot of intention around how we wanted to set up leadership in a way that didn't end up with that outcome. And I think we're on the right track. 

Speaker 3
I have to agree. I mean, I think what you said at the beginning about being motivated by the money, I thought was interesting. And to be clear, obviously I want to, as well as you guys, build a profitable business, that's the goal. But when you guys were in your sort of tumultuous, chaotic period in the transition, I'm kind of also in a career transition. And so I'm talking to Alejo casually about this project that he's starting. And it seemed like every week we would get maybe 2030 minutes on a weekend. Every week there was just insane growth from the last time we talked. Like wild things had changed so much so that I couldn't keep up and he couldn't keep up informing me. And then it got to the point where I'm like, hey, man, we've been talking about this for months. 

Speaker 3
I know a lot's changing on your end. Is there a place that you think I can fit at this point? I genuinely, and I think I said this, I don't care about the money. Obviously, when it comes to building a business, you want to be profitable. But I'm more fascinated about what you guys are building. And if I can be helpful in this process, let's start talking more regularly because I want to be a part of this. And that's sort of where the jump point came. I think, like mid December, maybe late December, where he said, okay, these are the meetings. Let's get you in the, you know, start talking regularly. And then had a chance to meet Powell and some of the other guys. And every time we had a conversation, I just felt so. I mean, I know that Alejo missed this. 

Speaker 3
I'm sure that you guys all miss this in other jobs or career paths where you're just doing something that, yeah, maybe you're good at, but there's nothing stimulating or exciting about what's happening. And that's what got my attention and the reason that I'm here and want to be here for the growth, because it's exciting. So that's kind of the reason. 

Speaker 1
That's awesome. You're hitting on a core part, which is the human man, human element. It is the foundation of our. We very quickly realized Paige has guided a lot of the search for why we're even here. I guess the story tells why we're here. What she has really helped with is figuring out what comes next. What is the future? And why is the future? You can call it a mission, you can call it a vision, you can call it an ethos. But amplifying the human has resonated with each of us. And it's beautiful what you said. The tech industry has a tendency to go towards more profit at any cost. Be it 11,000 people suddenly get laid off, be it last year, unnamed company goes, we're going to have to do some movements, we're freezing hiring, but don't worry, nobody's getting fired. 

Speaker 1
And two months later, people are getting fired. The human component that we are fully embracing. Thank you, Paige, for insisting so much. Because this would not have a future if it weren't because we're so sure of the impact we can have on the quality of life of humans. And it's funny to me because, Paige, you started with like, what am I even good at? We had to write two superpowers and hers were blank. I had one which was prompting, and I had a second and I didn't really know. The second one is like, sure, programming, but like a programmer, I've done programming. I know how to use the tools, I know the language is awesome. And suddenly Paige is driving the story and the mission. That's been very special. So I hope you never say I don't know what I'm good at ever again. 

Speaker 1
Because the process, some of us have it clearer than others, but it's a process, and it's so enjoyable to be going through that process with you guys. Which brings us to, what are we good at? What are our skills? Henry. 

Speaker 3
I want to hear from Henry. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. What do you think are your. 

Speaker 2
Well, I'm quite young, so I feel like I've got a slightly different, youngest perspective on things, and I think that can be valuable sometimes. But also I think something I've learned a lot recently is my adaptability and wanting to learn. And I feel like I feel quite good at frying information out of people, like wanting to understand and getting what I need in order to learn. So I think that's a skill in itself. And if we're talking fundamental skills, I've kind of know a bit of programming, kind of know some leadership skills. I like to do a bit of everything whilst I'm just learning, trying to decide, but, yeah, I don't know. 

Speaker 1
You've built some stuff for clients, right? 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
And are these, what, lead magnets landing? 

Speaker 2
Lead magnets ad campaigns? Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Cool. Thank you for sharing that. 

Speaker 4
Well, and if I can toot Henry's horn a little bit, something that Liam talks about in that first video that we watched is start with what, you know, start with something that excites you. Start with something you're passionate about. And I think that's why Henry's been successful in finding products or running away with ideas and building solutions from that place. He's super into skiing and he found a way or angle to get into the ski chalet business. He's like, well, I work at John Lewis. I don't need to look any further. And those things can be really easy to. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
I have to agree there. 

Speaker 3
I think probably two months ago, I don't know if any of us, including Henry, would have conceptualized where he is right now in the process of this potential offer for the product that you've created. And I think it's really awesome that you saw a problem, you saw that you could find a solution, you found it. And then obviously, with the team effort, you're now able to bring that solution to someone that can make a decision. And I think that intuition and the work ethic behind it cannot be overstated. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. Yesterday, or maybe it was yesterday. The day before, I was like, henry just asked the CEO if he could shadow him for two days, and he said yes. And I was, what? Like, what a g move. That's freaking awesome. And I love that you did. That's exactly what needs to be happening. It's freaking amazing. 

Speaker 1
So add to your list of qualities. 

Speaker 2
Okay. 

Speaker 1
Most certainly, Zach, for your skills. For your qualities, man. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I mean, I've been practicing for this question, right? I've probably done like, 30 interviews in the last couple of months. But I think the reality is, it's funny, I never saw myself as like, a sales guy because of the sort of negative connotation that most salespeople get. But I've been doing it for, and I don't even know why I haven't said this until now. I've been doing sales for almost twelve years, right. In some capacity or another, I've just been doing it. And I've now realized that's a huge strength that I have. And to be honest, two years ago, if you asked me the same question. I probably wouldn't have said that. 

Speaker 3
But now that I'm in this environment where I can help coach Henry and help coach Jorg on outreach and how to be slightly better, how to tweak an approach, that's probably one of my biggest strengths. And then the entrepreneurial mindset that I have to thank my family with because it started with my dad, and then I saw it growing up, and that's sort of just what I subconsciously copied. And now I find it very exciting to know Alejo in this position again. That's why I'm here. I see him with that same sort of entrepreneurial spirit and just being able to run with ideas and create something out of it. So I think those are probably the two things that I would say I'm strongest at and thoroughly enjoy. 

Speaker 1
This is May 2016. I go with Zach after a freshman year, back to his home. I meet his dad, I meet his mom, and the week that I was there, one of those days we drive to this office and he's pitching, showing the business plan to this guy. And that was our time there. I mean, finishing freshman year, like college kids, we could have been doing 1000 other things, and were, like, talking business and going to meetings and damn, eight years later, dude. Okay, enough of ours. We'll have time to reminisce. Wow. So we're talking skills. I know Python. The underlying workings of AIs, of large language models and different forms of machine learning. There's some clarity to me that I have that I've noticed not everybody else has. And I can create an image. 

Speaker 1
I can actually visualize an image of my head, of the inner workings. I've studied this for a lot of years. Still. I wouldn't put any of that in my top three skills. I think my top three, there's the ability to connect people together, to say, like, wait, I know who knows about this. I know who has a skill. And finding. Asking the right questions to find the right matches has proven to be immensely valuable. And what I want to do, that's exactly what I want to do. That is so what I want to do. Connecting people together. Mmm. 

Speaker 3
I think you're missing one, which is the ability to learn and the excitement for learning, which comes right after your ability to connect people. But it is rare that you find people that want to learn, especially at the level that you do, where if there's something you know nothing about, you will genuinely dive in 1000% until you feel like you're an expert, and then you'll keep going. And that is, I think, an important skill that you possess. 

Speaker 1
So true. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Even if it's like chess, for example. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. How did I ever learn so much about quantum mechanics? Right. My God, you're so right. So that's, number two, a relentless leaning towards learning more. And I guess number three, ties to number one, which is human connection. Human connection. That very much allows me to create a vision in my head and share the image with others, but help others feel that vision. So, connection, determination to learn, envision. Agree, Paige. 

Speaker 4
I played soccer for the better part of my younger years. Twelve years of soccer. Football. And my coaches always used to tell me that I could see the field really well. And I think that it's perspective. And underneath that is what I've recently embraced as a superpower, is empathy. I can truly feel what other people are feeling. I can put myself in a different place and imagine what it's like to be there, which can get very intense sometimes, but gives me a bit of a foresight into what might happen or what is this side going to think about it, what's the potential backlash in ten years? Let's make sure we're not the company that's getting criticized for making robots that take everyone's jobs because we know it's coming and it is people as well. 

Speaker 4
I've always been told that I have a grounded perspective, and I've found myself in many situations where people just start talking to me and they open up and they tell me their whole life story and they feel safe doing it. So I create that. And what's been on my mind as we've started, this is very much culture. Having experienced good cultures in organization and bad culture, I'm very keen on building a culture where people feel safe. People feel like they have a voice, like they belong, and it gets written off as soft skills and not important because it's not money making activities, it's not the bottom line. But when you have those things, the internal motivation and productivity that come from employees is night and day, but it's not so tangible. I've worked at companies where. 

Speaker 4
I worked at a company where I was forced to be there for 8 hours every day. It was paid hourly. I didn't have 40 hours of work a week. So I sat there feeling like I wasting my life. I started teaching myself python. I started just, like, trying to keep myself busy. And it's like, I'm doing my job. I'm doing my job very well, but I'm being forced to sit here because no one really cares about anything beyond the bottom line or the people. And I really believe that empowering people in whatever they're doing adds immense value to a company that can't always be directly quantified. And I've seen that with education, too. The same thing happens in a classroom. 

Speaker 4
If young people of students don't feel like they can raise their hand and give a wrong answer and not be taken down or judged for not knowing the right answer, if they don't feel like they can ask questions, they don't feel like they can be themselves, then their brain isn't open to learn. So it's culture, it's people, it's perspective. And with perspective, I think, comes seeing like, I'm a really good idea generator. I can see strategy, and I need support with some execution because I don't have the programming background and I don't know Python or anything like that. But the strategy part, I can see the field. 

Speaker 1
That's awesome. That's awesome. It is. 

Speaker 3
And strategy. Sorry. Is just as important as execution. 

Speaker 1
You came up with this phrase, this tagline that more and more we realize is who we are, which is amplifying the human. What does that mean? 

Speaker 4
It means to me, in this world of rapid change, advancing technology, we're all spending so much more time on screens, and it's finding the parts of our work and our lives that we're being. Human matters. We're being present matters, whether that's being present and with a client or a patient or being present with my family, because I have the time and freedom and flexibility to do that, is, I believe, where we find our greatest fulfillment and joy in life, and everybody wants it. And how do we amplify those parts of our lives which are our work? Like our work, we spend at least 8 hours a day in our lives, is a part of our lives. 

Speaker 4
Finding those parts where being human matters most and using technology to free up more time for that, let's automate the stuff that doesn't really matter if there's a human doing it or not, so that I have more time to nurture a client relationship, to sit down and talk with a patient rather than swipe through 15 minutes appointment slots, because that's what I'm filled up with. And then nobody really feels like they have the time of day. 

Speaker 1
Thank you. Yeah. So transitioning into the latter part of our conversation, I want to leave that question to that because that was very eloquent. That is exactly. Yes. What we're about, transitioning to the latter part of our conversation, what industries is faster ICE currently focusing on? We've mentioned a few. We've mentioned education, we've mentioned real estate, and there's also one that is evident when you start thinking about it, which is remote companies, within which industry, we'll figure it out. But fully remote companies, because we are one. So who can relate best to them? Who can build the best product for them? Another one, another fully remote company. And there are a lot of those nowadays. So I'm curious about how that might show up in our future clients. Regarding specific industries, education has come up a lot, over and over again. 

Speaker 1
And we kept trying to delay it. We kept trying to be like, well, we get to education from reasoning of there's not much money in that industry. It's not usually high margin, but with online platforms, costs are very low and margins are growing for those platforms. So education has become so much more feasible. And then real estate. We realized yesterday that people in Gen Xers in real estate think that they are first to this technology and they are in their circle. They are first meaning that we are zero. Whatever comes before first. And we can guide, we can educate, and we can grant tools that will allow them to be more human. We're such a human industry where it's all about relationships and you're like spending hours a week on admin bullshit. I'll edit that out of the. But no, keep it real. 

Speaker 1
It's real. Thank you, Paige, for helping me see it, for helping all of us see how we can create an impact. The industry will take the shape that it takes and we can create real impact in human lives. Is there anyone, any other industry that comes up that we have strong interest in? We've mentioned vacation rentals. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, vacation rentals is kind of real estate, but I also see the industries. I feel like I see the industries to come in terms of the massive gap. When AgI is starting to be adopted, there's going to be millions of people left with nothing to do or people that are put on universal basic income and want to find purpose. And that's a whole new industry that will be created. And I think that's where we can amplify the human and help. And I also want to be the voice that kind of explains AI, because, for example, as of like this week, Sora just got released. And if you go on Twitter and you look at the comments, it's all just people are very scared and quite frankly, just ill informed and just acting off of what they see. 

Speaker 2
So allowing people to make the transition from our economy now into what it will become and what normal lifestyle might quite. It's just Prohuman, really, if we can help with. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Paige mentioned online project based learning, which is where we hope education will go into. Because nowadays you have the tools, you have the self learning, you have the self paced, and you also need guidance. So does guidance really mean nowadays to have a person who is, by all intents and purposes in that environment, the person that knows everything, that has all the answers, preaching in the front of the classroom? Is that the most effective way for people to learn nowadays, for kids to learn nowadays? So when it comes to education, there's so many branches we're so interested about something anybody would like to add before we move into some solutions we built. 

Speaker 4
Other than niching down to say that we're at least starting out looking at companies that are medium sized businesses, small to medium sized, because some of the larger corporations likely already have SaaS systems that they're implementing a lot of these solutions within. And there are a lot of barriers that come with approaching companies that are massive with online project based learning. It's what was missing from the workshop yesterday. It's what's missing on most online learning platforms. It's what's missing in a lot of live platforms. There are schools that are set up as project based learning and that's what the kids do all year round. And it's amazing and it's beautiful, but it's not the norm. Far from it. Yeah, I think we can offer that. We can offer it to a lot of different people, of. We can offer it to young people. 

Speaker 4
I see AI as an empowerment tool of what do you want to do? Because you can create your life and you have all the skills and tools right in front of you. Let's work on a project together and learn together. You can sit here, you can look at these demonstrations, you can hear me talk about it, but if you're not in there doing it, building something that's meaningful to you, it's not going to stick. And that's what that workshop needed yesterday. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. That is what the workshop needed yesterday. Yeah. We have the strategies to make it stick. We're so well positioned to help people really embrace and integrate this into their lives so well, in so many dimensions, in the information and knowledge, in the facilitation, the way to make it thick, the understanding of how to attract people to an online event. We have everything we need. We can help so many people. So cool. And we see the gaps. Oh, my God, we see the gaps. Yeah. So what solutions have we built so far? 

Speaker 1
Starting with, we built a lead qualifier initially that will go through a series of questions in a chat format, in a normal conversation, and for incomplete answers or answers that the person maybe didn't fully understand, there's backtracking and the conversation will flow regarding how useful are these answers to qualifying this lead? And we'll go through the full list of questions. That's one solution we initially built. And any tweaks to it can be. We can do any tweaks for any specific use cases, be it changing the industry, being changing the number of questions, the depth that the questions need to be answered at. So that was very interesting to build out first. Henry, what else have we built? And how did you summarize it in two sentences? 

Speaker 2
It's quite hard to summarize. I mean, scheduling assistant was a monotonous task done by people every day, and we simplified that into, quite frankly, just an algorithm that sorts out all the roles and stuff. And what's great about AI is it allows you to talk to these algorithms. So, hey, can we actually do this time with this algorithm? So, yeah, I'd say the scheduling assistant is one I can. But short. I think you're muted, Ella. 

Speaker 1
Main benefit being the amount of time I get saved on this very tedious task, scheduling 200 employees every day, and the mayhem of waking up with any of the 200, being sick and having to not even recalculate, redraw everything, whole chain of events. Yeah. And we have also built a vacation rental concierge, which 24/7 will help you improve the experience of the guests in their trip. What we specialized it on was on ski trips, ski chalets, and it is incredible. With a simple knowledge base about the chalet, about where they're staying, we can plan out a whole day for them, full of activities, including skiing, of course. We can find out real time information on the ski lifts of different mountains, wherever they can go or want to go skiing, and find restaurants and shops nearby. 

Speaker 1
And we've created some really cool integrations for those three use cases then projects we're working on. Number one, personalized massive outreach, using context from people's socials and recent posts to create outreach that is even the initial prototype. Surprisingly natural sounding and something that kind of, oh, I wish I had written that. And it was quite impressive to have that be the initial prototype. Awesome. We are also building a knowledge base builder that will take all the information of your company as much or as little as you want to give it of meetings with a team, meetings with clients, obviously respecting whatever privacy settings. They want to have new documents, all kinds of documents that we want to get information from. And one of the cooler things that we want to build is gated access to information. 

Speaker 1
What that looks like is the sales manager asking a question, the CEO asking the exact same question, looking at the same information and outputting a different answer. The validity and truth of the answer is still the same. The relevance is what's different? What does this person care about that is going to make an effective, concise answer. And a million other applications that can come from a knowledge base. That's the one I'm most excited about. 

Speaker 4
So now I'm going to challenge you to resummarize that in two sentences. And also don't yell it. 

Speaker 1
The product I'm most excited about is a knowledge base builder. Imagine full access to everything that's going on in your company tailored to your position and what you need in that moment. 

Speaker 3
Can you give me a quick example? 

Speaker 1
I need last quarter's sale report asks the sales manager. I need last quarter sales report asks the CEO. The sales manager gets details on each salesperson, branch specific product sold, all the details. The CEO gets the execute summary, same exact question. The answer is what's relevant to each of them. 

Speaker 3
Maybe the CEO also gets last quarter and the fourth quarter of the previous year to compare. 

Speaker 1
Now we're talking relevance. Relevance, yeah. And what that looks like in each company is completely different. That's why making a SaaS product out of this, where you're just selling it for a subscription and it's plug and play is that much harder. And Google is doing it and Microsoft is doing it within their own ecosystems. You have to have everything, Microsoft for everything to be included. Everything, Google for everything to be included. And how relevant we'll see. They can build great, awesome products. The tailored part is what we can do. 

Speaker 4
So many connections, so many synopsis. When talking to young children, young people, where they are in their brain development, it's very hard for them to understand abstract concepts and in order for them to grasp it, we have to bring it down to earth and give concrete examples, which is what Zach did when he prompted this question. We're not talking to kids, but we kind of are talking to kids who have no idea what is thinking. Having that in our minds as we explain what these products are, I'm not going to really be able to visualize, oh, having full access to a knowledge base that knows everything about my company. 

Speaker 1
Okay. 

Speaker 4
It's a little fuzzy. Oh. You sign into your slack or whatever portal you're on, and you ask the chatbot integrated right there. I need this. And it gives you tailored data based on exactly what you need. That's the concrete that I think we need to focus on when we're selling this stuff, when we're talking to people, especially, that don't have the lingo about what we can do. It's explaining it in a way that they can visualize their day to day being impacted by AI or some solution. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. Thank you, Paige. That is an awesome point. Make it tangible. Show the example. 

Speaker 4
Make it concrete. 

Speaker 1
Concrete. 

Speaker 4
And what we've been practicing with. Say this in two sentences, is called economy of language. Your words are more powerful when you use fewer of them. And that's just the math of it. 

Speaker 2
They also fitness short. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. And you keep people's attention, which our attention span is shrinking, for sure. I'm seeing it very tangibly with young people. My goodness. Their attention span is. 

Speaker 2
You can blame that on TikTok. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, that's TikTok, and it's happening, too. We have less attention span. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. I mean, so I'm just thinking how all these things are coming around. If you think, what, ten years ago, we didn't have. Just about ten years ago, we didn't have the phone. Then 150 years ago, there wasn't a steam engine. And then, what, 1500 years ago, there was an agriculture. It's all just exponentially going crazy. So who knows? Two years from now, what might the future look like? 

Speaker 4
Yeah. It was a very interesting approach that this speaker took yesterday. He made a few comments about, you guys might not like it, but this is the world you got to accept. You got to adapt. And it was very almost stern, dad, like, toughen up. This is how it is. You got to get on board or else you're going to get left behind. And it was like, okay, I hear you. And also, interesting approach. Yeah. And it's true. I mean, it's true what he's. It's. It's inevitable. And we can embrace it or we can let it pass us. Things. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
There's a Alex Friedman podcast from, I think a few weeks ago, it might have been the one with Elon. 

Speaker 1
Or. 

Speaker 3
Maybe it was Zuck, but he talked about how, kind of, for the last 500 years or so, there were revolutions, like sort of every century, and we're at a point in time now where those revolutions are mostly technology based, and they're happening every year now. Like, went through AI we're still in it, but it's active. We're now going into what Apple's calling spatial computing and virtual reality. That's a whole revolution in itself where you can do Iron man shit in real life now. It's fascinating how quickly the revolutions are now happening. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I think one of the things I was reading about recently was in San Francisco, there was a bunch of people that attacked a autonomous AI driving car and they set it all on fire in revolt of AI. So it's scary to think, and then what's logical is then using AI to contain the situation because it's the most effective way. And I can only see that just creating mess and that would be minimizing. 

Speaker 1
The human as opposed to amplifying. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
So educating is one way to amplify then. 

Speaker 4
So the speaker, Chris yesterday showed some photos of himself going to the Apple store to try on the new apple goggles. And he was sharing a little bit about his experience and I've never seen anything like this and whatnot, and then showing the use cases for it within the real estate, which is now. How much time would you save for yourself and your family if you don't have to go for 15 houses in person? You can put on a headset and do a virtual tour. And there are companies that are already doing that for the real estate business. He had a couple of websites that he shared for tools around that. But it's interesting, like, oh yeah, that's way more convenient. I don't even have to leave my house. 

Speaker 4
And then on the other side I can also see, like, I don't get that feel. I don't get the kinesthetic feel of the house. And I haven't experienced the goggles yet, but I'm sure it is very real feeling. But there might be other people that prefer being in the space and feeling the energy that lives there, because that's also a real thing. 

Speaker 1
And let's definitely not take that out of the equation of buying a house. Of course. What if you can sift through ten houses and then go feel three of them? It's like, oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense for everyone. As opposed to spending ten minutes in the ten houses, you can spend 30 minutes in each one that you have some intuition could be the ones. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. It's interesting because it could be fully virtual. But if we keep thinking how do you amplify the human feel? Then the average are right in front of us. The experience of the human. And how can we amplify that. 

Speaker 1
No, not only virtual tours, but how could that help with amplifying the important part, which is I do want to spend 30 minutes checking out this house and sitting in every room and as opposed to being rushed, because I got to go check out the next one. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, it's exactly what you're saying. You spend more time with the human, the agent in the houses that you've already gained insight on that you're actually interested in buying that further qualifying the lead. 

Speaker 1
Exactly. 

Speaker 3
I wanted to ask. Sorry, go ahead. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, I got to go. I have another call, but. Yes, go ahead. 

Speaker 3
Well, I was just going to say, how do we ensure privacy, sort of, before we exit this conversation. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, there's two ways. Three ways. Number one, Microsoft Azure, the Microsoft cloud platform called azure is the industry standard. Everything is tunable through settings. That's number one, how do we ensure we go with the industry standard? Number two, when it comes to AI, there's two ways. One, that requires trust, which is through OpenAI, fine tuned models that data never gets trained on. For OpenAI, this is all part of the policies and things that they have touched on again and again. There's a button chat GBT that you can click and it's like, don't train on my data and won't. The trust component is you are still sending that information over to a server that is not your server. So that's number two that I trust, but I can't assume that others will. 

Speaker 1
The policy is there's buttons that say, don't train on my data and that doesn't get trained on. 

Speaker 2
Yes. 

Speaker 1
When you're talking about building fine tuning models, that's by default. And then there's number three, which is a local model. It's not OpenAI, but just call it an open source model. Everything gets computed in your computer. Nothing ever leaves your computer unless you explicitly create a function that sends information somewhere. Those are the three ways that are the clearest, most accepted ways to ensure privacy. 

Speaker 3
So from my understanding, in a real world example, an HR department for General Motors, they have health documents for thousands of employees, Social Security numbers, addresses, all that kind of delicate data. From their perspective, the most valuable way to have a system that we can provide them but still keep privacy at a number one is a local model. 

Speaker 1
Correct. Perfect. And General Motors can pay for it. 

Speaker 3
Definitely. 

Speaker 1
Because they're expensive. 

Speaker 3
Very expensive. Yes. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, they're very expensive. 

Speaker 2
Something this brings to mind what were talking about yesterday when were talking about creating our vector databases and access levels. Within the rag, like, who can? The CEO can only access this data about the company and whoever else can only access X. And I think one of the strongest things, I think, is just trying to jailbreak the model yourself, because if you try to jailbreak it, you'll eventually find out if it's secure or not. There's many funny examples of chat bots on the Chevrolet website where it's just like, I remember the example, but it was a funny one to drop it in the chat. 

Speaker 3
I can give one. I've been doing interviews with them, and their second round interview is a chat bot. And I actually broke it because I didn't have audio for the first two videos, so I had to redo it. The questions changed. They were different. They asked me a question. I recorded a three minute video submit, and then it goes into the ether. They ask me another question, submit, it goes into the ether. But if I reset that process, it has to be done by management. Then it's different questions. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. Yes. Okay. When it comes to, I think you got a right, we have to be very careful, and we have the right people to ask, too. We have the right advisors for that, and we also have the people to build it, which they're not in the organization right now. But the time will come where we'll be building local models for high ticket clients, high ticket organizations. And in the meantime, fine tuning OpenAI models that are privacy proof. I'll vouch for that because it's the only viable option. And you can have a discussion about how might break it and steal information or use that information unethically. Let's see. Shut the hell up. That's amazing. That's a legally binding. 

Speaker 2
Wow. 

Speaker 4
Crazy. 

Speaker 1
Bro. What did you ask? What is before? 

Speaker 2
I'm just finding there's so many bad ones, but, yeah, they must have had it open for like, a day. I'm just finding images. 

Speaker 1
This is wonderful. This is great. Yeah. 

Speaker 2
But it's so obvious to me how that happened. It's just they uploaded chat GPT into the. All they did was add a system prompt, and the system prompt was probably quite bad. 

Speaker 1
That's great, man. Okay, I got to go. I'm glad we did this, you guys. This is fuel. 

Speaker 2
Me, too. 

Speaker 1
For the future of best rice. 

Speaker 3
Indeed. 

Speaker 1
Indeed it is. 

Speaker 3
All right, I'll reach at 230, right? Or in an hour? 

Speaker 1
Yes. Perfect. 

Speaker 2
Peace, guys. 

Speaker 1
See you all later, guys.
