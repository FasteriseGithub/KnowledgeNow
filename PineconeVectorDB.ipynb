you guys been up to?\\n\\nFucking sell it\\n\\nFucking sell it\\n\\nOh yeah\\n\\nOh yeah\\n\\nWell you know the news\\n\\nWell you know the news\\n\\nYeah\\n\\nYou already bring the book with you\\n\\nIt's a printer ok\\n\\nI thought it's a book\\n\\nNo it's a stand\\n\\nOh\\n\\nOh\\n\\nHere's a couple updates\\n\\nHere's a couple updates\\n\\nOn books\\n\\nLet's see\\n\\nLet's find it\\n\\nSo\\n\\nWait for\\n\\nWait for\\n\\nWait for\\n\\nWait for\\n\\nWait for\\n\\nWait for\\n\\nUpdate number one\\n\\nWe are incorporated\\n\\nIn the US for now\\n\\nAnd at some point somewhere else\\n\\nWe're a Delaware LLC\\n\\nWe also\\n\\nOpened a bank account\\n\\nSo we can start actually\\n\\nCharging for our work\\n\\nThat's number two\\n\\nAnd number three\\n\\nAnd most importantly\\n\\nMan they gave me like\\n\\n100 pages of stuff\\n\\nThis is like\\n\\nFucking thick\\n\\nJust so much fucking paper\\n\\nLike hey can you send it to me digitally\\n\\nIt's like oh you can find it online\\n\\nIt's like then why are you giving me this paper\\n\\nAnyway\\n\\nThat's the minor\\n\\nThe major\\n\\nIs that yesterday\\n\\nWe got together with\\n\\nPaige\\n\\nAnd one of her\\n\\nCousins\\n\\nAnd they do real estate\\n\\nThey do mortgage lending\\n\\nSpecifically\\n\\nAt the beginning\\n\\nAnd at the end of the real estate process\\n\\nOf buying a home\\n\\nThat's where they come in\\n\\nHey this is how much money you will probably have\\n\\nTo buy a house\\n\\nA mortgage that will approve you for\\n\\nAnd then at the end is\\n\\nOkay now let's actually do the approval process\\n\\nIn between a lot of things happen\\n\\nAnd when you're\\n\\nBig\\n\\nAs a mortgage lender like they are\\n\\nWe'll talk more about real estate\\n\\nAnd I'm still getting educated\\n\\nBut I'll get you guys up to speed\\n\\nWith how the whole process works\\n\\nWhen you start getting big\\n\\nThe interactions\\n\\nYou start having more leverage\\n\\nWith the interactions\\n\\nLike you start having real estate agents\\n\\nThat you trust\\n\\nThat you send customers to\\n\\nAs opposed to the other way around\\n\\nWhen you're small in mortgage lending\\n\\nReal estate agents\\n\\nThey have more reliance to you\\n\\nSo they have the leverage\\n\\nSo they charge more\\n\\nAnd you charge less\\n\\nWell in this case\\n\\nIt's the mortgage lender\\n\\nIs big\\n\\nAnd has the leverage\\n\\nWhich is great\\n\\nBecause they get to decide\\n\\nWhat their process looks like\\n\\nAnd they are ready to automate stuff\\n\\nSo they get to decide\\n\\nWhat their process looks like\\n\\nAnd we had a great meeting\\n\\nGoing over everything they want to implement\\n\\nAs of right now\\n\\nMore ideas will come\\n\\nThe initial deal\\n\\nAnd we'll get this drafted up\\n\\nSo we can all\\n\\nSign it\\n\\nThat actual legal document\\n\\nWe're going to start with\\n\\nTwo minor automations\\n\\nMajor to them\\n\\nMinor to programmers\\n\\nThey're simple enough\\n\\nWe just have to find\\n\\nThe right services for it\\n\\nAnd try them out\\n\\nOn our own\\n\\nAnd by next\\n\\nWednesday\\n\\nHave\\n\\nSomething to share with them\\n\\nSo you get an idea\\n\\nOne of the automations\\n\\nIs something I was able to do in 15 minutes\\n\\nSo\\n\\nIt's nothing that we can't do\\n\\nAs long as we're\\n\\nSort of focused\\n\\nSo I'll show you guys\\n\\nWhat we talked about\\n\\nAnd I'll show you\\n\\nWhat this will look like\\n\\nAnd how the services connect\\n\\nWhat questions can I answer so far\\n\\nIf any\\n\\nIs it\\n\\nNo\\n\\nI just wanted to say\\n\\nMore details on what the actual thing is\\n\\nIs it a paid opportunity?\\n\\nThis is going to become\\n\\nA paid opportunity\\n\\nThese first couple automations\\n\\nThe amount of referrals\\n\\nThat are going to come through\\n\\nThis one person\\n\\nIs pretty absurd\\n\\nIt works pretty\\n\\nSymbiotically\\n\\nEverything wants her team\\n\\nTo be more productive\\n\\nThis is not a real estate agent\\n\\nVersus real estate agent\\n\\nIt's more of a\\n\\nIf everybody is more productive, everybody wins\\n\\nWhich is great, it's a great place to be in\\n\\nSo the first couple automations\\n\\nWe're doing for free, they're simple enough\\n\\nWe're expecting referrals\\n\\nAnd\\n\\nFrom third automation onward\\n\\nWe are charging for\\n\\nRetainer\\n\\nAnd per product\\n\\nWe'll dig into those details\\n\\nNext week at a general executive meeting\\n\\nOnce we have all the details\\n\\nOnce we actually bring the proposal\\n\\nAre you and Paige still in Maryland?\\n\\nUntil tomorrow\\n\\nWhere are you going after that?\\n\\nAustralia\\n\\nProject number one\\n\\nVery straightforward\\n\\nText message\\n\\nMake a calendar event\\n\\nLet's meet tomorrow at\\n\\n3pm at the cafe\\n\\nThis gets triggered\\n\\nGoogle Calendar event gets created\\n\\nThey're not using Slack or something?\\n\\nThey use text messages\\n\\nLike SMS?\\n\\nYep\\n\\nThat's basically a feature of Google Calendar\\n\\nIn Slack\\n\\nIs a chatbot okay for this?\\n\\nSorry?\\n\\nIs a chatbot on\\n\\nVoiceflow\\n\\nGood for that task?\\n\\nIn this case\\n\\nIt's even simpler than that\\n\\nIt's just\\n\\nBeing able to identify\\n\\nWhen the trigger\\n\\nNeeds to happen\\n\\nAnd the triggers\\n\\nTend to be pretty obvious\\n\\nThere's a 3pm\\n\\nIn the text\\n\\nWe'll have to figure out together\\n\\nWhat does it look like\\n\\nFor the trigger to be proper\\n\\nI'm sure there's vast research on this\\n\\n\\nbut yes, we are looking at their text messages, a service I found to simplify the process\\n\\nis Open Phone.\\n\\nI don't know if anybody has heard of it, but there has to be several services that allow\\n\\nyou to look at text and trigger something.\\n\\nThere might be some nuances here as to how this will work.\\n\\nThe iPhones might have some restrictions, we have to look into that.\\n\\nHowever, I think that this will be pretty straightforward.\\n\\nWhat is it, what is it?\\n\\nSo we can backtrack, I just want to move forward with what the client talked about.\\n\\nA text message would also, in some cases, in most cases that Google Calendar even needs\\n\\nto get created.\\n\\nAlso a task in their CRM would also need to happen.\\n\\nTheir CRM is called Follow Up Boss.\\n\\nWe're going to sort of try it out and try it out for ourselves.\\n\\nWe have a bunch of lead lists, so we're going to do that process ourselves, get familiarised\\n\\nwith the platform and start essentially doing the thing that they want to do for ourselves.\\n\\nAnd this is part of what we're doing from here to Wednesday.\\n\\nMaking sure that once they're like, okay, let's go, okay, great, give me a login and\\n\\npassword or API keys, and we can actually get to work as opposed to getting familiarised\\n\\nonce things are signed.\\n\\nSo task number two that we're doing this week is getting familiarised with the CRM.\\n\\nWait, so do we have logins to the Follow Up Boss?\\n\\nWe're going to create an account ourselves.\\n\\nWhat I find with a lot of these platforms is they're platforms and then they're similar\\n\\nand then your business customises it.\\n\\nSo I'd rather have logins to theirs to see how they've customised it already, if that\\n\\nmakes sense.\\n\\nSo for example, in Go High Level, I had a client who had a Go High Level set up and\\n\\nthere are some different automations and flows and you can see the stages of their\\n\\npipeline.\\n\\nThat was really, really useful to me.\\n\\nSo if we could have just a, maybe we have our own account as well, but if we also have\\n\\na just an account that can just look at stuff on theirs, that'd be interesting.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nWell, I think there is like two things in here.\\n\\nLike first, yeah, we need access to their stuff to see their process.\\n\\nEven better, if we make like a business analysis, we will get access, just not today.\\n\\nIf you guys feel like that's something that we need to have by Monday to actually do the\\n\\nprocess right, I'm happy to ask and we can go from there.\\n\\nI think we need at least like a video, but I'm not sure how are they tech savvy to show\\n\\nit all.\\n\\nSo maybe it's better to have credentials, but on the finishing note, like we definitely\\n\\ndon't want to do it like first time in their account, we definitely want to have a test\\n\\nenvironment.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nSo we're definitely doing it in other accounts first, we just in their account, we're just\\n\\nlooking and it would be actually best, but I'm not sure if that's cost effective, because\\n\\nif this is a free client, then I don't think it's good to make business analysis for free\\n\\nunless they want to pay, but I'm not sure if they want to pay for it.\\n\\nThis is a free client with huge potential.\\n\\nSo whatever investment needs to get done, be it time or money, I'm pretty sure that\\n\\nyou can create an account and follow a boss for free, for example.\\n\\nWhen it comes to business analysis, they know what they want, which is this, this is one\\n\\nof the things that they want.\\n\\nSo when it comes to analysis, yes, let's make sure we can dive deep, but we barely understand\\n\\nthe real estate process at this point.\\n\\nSo in this case, we have the awesome circumstance that they know what they want and implementing\\n\\nit is relatively straightforward, as opposed to a client that has the business, not really\\n\\nsure how they see automations in that business, and then we need to give a full report of\\n\\nwhat they will need.\\n\\nSo that's-\\n\\nNo guys, I'm actually second guessing this whole concern because in the follow up boss,\\n\\nwe just have to create a task.\\n\\nI don't think we need to know the structure to create a task.\\n\\nCorrect, but to do a full business analysis, we would need to know the process.\\n\\nYeah, I'm just disregarding like at this early stage, I just disregarded the thought that we\\n\\nneed to analyze this because it's straightforward and it's just create a task.\\n\\nSo I don't think we need to know that their CRM structure even, but it will be safer to know.\\n\\nIf you could get the access, it will be definitely safer and possibly could save us some time\\n\\nspent that we would be trying to guess rather than just see.\\n\\nYes, so absolutely, absolutely.\\n\\nOK, so let's move on and we can backtrack.\\n\\nAlso, I looked into the follow up boss API and it looks great, man.\\n\\nIt looks very well documented.\\n\\nYou can do anything and everything.\\n\\nWe're getting very lucky with this.\\n\\nOK, they want to do the same things for emails, but not yet because their company, their big\\n\\nagency needs to approve the integration of sending emails somewhere else.\\n\\nSo this is on standby for emails.\\n\\nThis is a go for text messages.\\n\\nMoving on. Action plans.\\n\\nSo within follow up boss and I'm going to go create an account and put some leads and walk\\n\\nyou guys through through a lot of this, probably on Monday.\\n\\nWe have something called action plans.\\n\\nSo a task would be something like send follow up email, but an action plan would be OK.\\n\\nAnd what happens after?\\n\\nSo a bit of a sequence, if you will.\\n\\nAction plans will not only be emails in their business and how they are running their\\n\\nbusiness. Physical things are a big way that they show appreciation.\\n\\nSo some small gifts like a, let's call it a fruit basket or a small bottle of champagne for\\n\\nclosing a deal, for example.\\n\\nThis might go to to clients.\\n\\nThis might also go to realtors.\\n\\nSo think about it as there's a bunch of people that came to see this one house at an open\\n\\nhouse. Hey, and they all get the tour and whatever.\\n\\nAnd afterwards, they'll all put their emails in and they need to receive a follow up email.\\n\\nAn action plan would automate the who needs to receive the thank you email for coming and\\n\\nwhat happens after.\\n\\nAnd they would automatically be set into that flow.\\n\\nSo classic CRM stuff.\\n\\nAs we say, hey, these 30 people came, these 30 new leads came to the open house, we would\\n\\nalso tag them.\\n\\nAnd again, the API allows you to do all of this.\\n\\nWe would tag them with open house February so they can keep track of it and also we can\\n\\nkeep track of it programmatically.\\n\\nThis is one of the big things they want to do with follow up bosses, action plans.\\n\\nAnd then there's something that we are going to do that a lot of future referrals are going to\\n\\nwant and need because a lot of her realtors that she's connected to don't even use a CRM and she\\n\\nexplained two statistics.\\n\\nNumber one, realtors start, say, branching out and to hiring people and would be interested or\\n\\nactually can afford outside services once they hit about $5 million in sales.\\n\\nIt's a random figure right now.\\n\\nSo don't worry about the actual $5 million.\\n\\nHowever, it is also a causality that if you're not using a CRM, you're not going to get a\\n\\njob. That if you're not using a CRM, being successful as a real estate agent is very, very\\n\\nhard.\\n\\n\\nSo, this migration allows for real estate agents who are still managing their leads\\n\\nin spreadsheets to unlock one of the tools that will help them become successful in that\\n\\nbusiness.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nSo, this is partly for future uses, for future clients, for future referrals.\\n\\nHowever, this is a great first step for us to get very familiar with the API and with the actual CRM.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nI think what's interesting about the CRM as compared to spreadsheets is, one, to the client, it might not look much,\\n\\nbut the capabilities it would give us or them, for example, just triggering stuff off a CRM,\\n\\ninstead of having, you're not going to trigger stuff off a spreadsheet.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nGood point.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nYou have a ceiling of what you can do.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nThose are the three main things, three main flows, let's call it.\\n\\nHowever, we talked for like two hours in chunk.\\n\\nSo, this is all the notes we took, all the different things they wanted to do.\\n\\nI'm going to very quickly go over them and then we're going to move on.\\n\\nI want us to look at the API and just answer any questions that you guys have.\\n\\nSo, text and emails trigger a calendar event with a reminder.\\n\\nLet's look into reminder later.\\n\\nRobust action plans automations.\\n\\nTask, person with a certain task, meaning create task for person with certain tasks.\\n\\nThis may not only be one person.\\n\\nThis could be their social media manager.\\n\\nThis could be their email marketer.\\n\\nSo, create a task for this person with a certain task.\\n\\nThen there's follow-ups and touch bases.\\n\\nWe talked about gifts.\\n\\nSometimes they send something and they have a service for this.\\n\\nSo, us triggering an automation where it's like, hey, once a quarter, so start of the quarter,\\n\\nthe automation sends an email to the gift company with details of all people to send gifts to.\\n\\nJust going to move on.\\n\\nThis is not what is important right now.\\n\\nI just want you guys to see all that we talked about and all the ideas that this person gave us,\\n\\nthat they want to implement.\\n\\nHandwritten card, that's another service that they use.\\n\\nThey want it to be triggered automatically.\\n\\nSo, they don't actually have to go to the website and say, hey, it's this person,\\n\\nand this is the email, and that's the email, and this is the card, whatever.\\n\\nSo, automate this.\\n\\nAnd then things like for the realtors, meeting up once a quarter, for example.\\n\\nHey, let's have lunch next week.\\n\\nAnd that's a simple text.\\n\\nVery simple things that we can do.\\n\\nMigration to follow-up box, so move leads from spreadsheets to follow-up box.\\n\\nSocial media automations.\\n\\nThe main one is integrations, to be able to post once and post everywhere.\\n\\nObviously, if it's a video or if it's a text post, it might not go to TikTok, right?\\n\\nBut essentially, post once, post everywhere relative to the type of post.\\n\\nAnd then there's some future ones.\\n\\nThis is where the retainer comes in.\\n\\nShe has expressed a lot of desire to implement different AI tools that help with productivity.\\n\\nFor example, Opus Pro grabs a video and creates a bunch of shorts out of it.\\n\\nI see Henry smiling.\\n\\nWe've been trying it for some of our meetings.\\n\\nThe last few days, we actually bought the full subscription.\\n\\nAnd man, it's fucking sick.\\n\\nIt's so good.\\n\\nAnd we showed it to her.\\n\\nAnd she's like, yes, this is something that I want.\\n\\nCan you do this for me?\\n\\nIt's like, sure, we can do this for you.\\n\\nThis is not really what we do.\\n\\nBut their social media person doesn't know this tool.\\n\\nSo when we're talking retainer, this actually has a purpose, which is new tools are coming out.\\n\\nHow can we help you improve your productivity consistently over time?\\n\\nAnd that's what the retainer is for.\\n\\nSometimes it was fuzzy to me.\\n\\nLike, hey, why are you charging a retainer for a chatbot?\\n\\nSure, maintenance and stuff, but does that mean the chatbot is going to break at any point?\\n\\nIt might.\\n\\nOkay, so it feels like you're telling me you're selling me this great thing, but then that it's going to break.\\n\\nAnd the value of the retainer was fuzzy to me.\\n\\nThis feels like great value to help their business continue to grow.\\n\\nAnd social media is huge in real estate.\\n\\nAnd then, again, post retainer, create posts with my style, with Canva.\\n\\nThis is kind of what she said.\\n\\nYou know, regarding the retainer feasibility, you can also say, and it's the truth.\\n\\nI mean, is the chatbot going to break?\\n\\nYeah, it can.\\n\\nBecause every time OpenAI makes an update, prompts that you've written before might not work again.\\n\\nAnd prompts written six months ago will probably not work as good as on the day of writing it.\\n\\nSo yeah, you can communicate to the clients like this.\\n\\nEvery time OpenAI makes an update, everything changes, basically.\\n\\nYeah, my problem with that is the perceived value goes down if they're constantly thinking.\\n\\nSo I think that's just a gray area to avoid.\\n\\nBut to go down the route of they will continuously look out for new tools and be trying to implement.\\n\\nYeah, but you're not saying it will break.\\n\\nAnd you're actually washing hands because you're putting it all on OpenAI.\\n\\nAnd you teach them that this technology looks like this.\\n\\nThis is a big player that gives us all the capabilities in here.\\n\\nAnd every time they make an update, things might break.\\n\\nAnd it's just the way it is.\\n\\nAnd you need to just frame it as an educational value rather than you explaining yourself.\\n\\nYeah, I mean, I agree.\\n\\nBut I also think there's kind of an edge to them not knowing.\\n\\nAlso, getting them on educating that much would take a lot of time.\\n\\nI don't know.\\n\\nWell, they're definitely early adopters.\\n\\nAlso, they think they're first to finding about AI tools.\\n\\nAnd it's been a year and a half.\\n\\nWe are so well-positioned.\\n\\nIt's ridiculous how well-positioned we are that they think they're first.\\n\\nSo I love the intellectual debate of retainer and how to show the value.\\n\\nAnd kind of washing your hands.\\n\\nBecause, yes, it is not our fault, but we can fix it.\\n\\nSo that's going to come up inevitably.\\n\\nMaybe not with this client, but in the future.\\n\\nSo thank you for your input, Bartek.\\n\\nKnowing that there are things outside of us that are changing.\\n\\nAnd you need someone very qualified to be able to adapt to the change.\\n\\nSo your chatbot keeps improving, not deteriorating over time.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nMoving on.\\n\\nEmail automations.\\n\\nThis is for the near-medium future, because they now depend on a corporation\\n\\nto approve having their emails being read by an outside service.\\n\\nAnd there's some sensitive information, like, where do I live?\\n\\nI'm looking to buy this house.\\n\\nThis is how much money I have.\\n\\nThis is how much I got approved for.\\n\\nVery sensitive information, so we need to treat it carefully.\\n\\nBut for the simpler stuff, that doesn't really require us taking information\\n\\nout of their email, but us putting information in is newsletters.\\n\\nRight now, she has newsletters that are done mostly manually,\\n\\nbut they don't even have the name personalization.\\n\\nIt's just a newsletter that goes out to everybody.\\n\\nSo at the very least, we can help with that.\\n\\nAnd we're going to be able to help with other stuff,\\n\\nbut we didn't really dig into what the perfect newsletter would be.\\n\\nBut would this relate to a CRM automation of knowing who to send\\n\\nthe newsletter to?\\n\\nHow can we help improve CTA for the reading the email to actually\\n\\nleave somewhere or ask for feedback from the newsletter?\\n\\nHey, what would you like to know about the state of real estate this year?\\n\\nI said state a lot of times.\\n\\nSo this is for later, but newsletter is one thing that they're interested in.\\n\\nAnd then comes the bigger conversation of privacy for the future.\\n\\nLet's say the corporation doesn't approve the use case\\n\\nof having the emails being read by an outside service.\\n\\n\\nthat's not going to look like, yeah, just send them to OpenAI and they can train with\\n\\nthose emails because there is private sensitive data in there.\\n\\nSo how do we ensure privacy?\\n\\nOne way is actually going through the fine-tuning process that OpenAI has available where anything\\n\\nthat gets trained or any, I believe I have to confirm this, but any inputs or outputs\\n\\nare not used, so are not trained on.\\n\\nI have to confirm that.\\n\\nHowever, today and always, local models will be the big privacy thing.\\n\\nRunning on our server, running on their server, whatever, but local models would be the winner\\n\\nhere.\\n\\nI'm talking about a much higher price tag here.\\n\\nSo it's also a conversation for later on.\\n\\nBecause I'm assuming it's like a big corporation, right?\\n\\nIt's a big corporation and they are a smaller company within that corporation.\\n\\nI'm not sure what the exact business legal relationship is, but yes, they work inside\\n\\nof this corporation.\\n\\nThey probably pay fees or whatever.\\n\\nAnd what this corporation allows them to do is sign the mortgages because it's not coming\\n\\nout of these people's bank accounts when they're like, yeah, you're approved for $500,000 a\\n\\nmonth.\\n\\nIt's not their bank account that it comes out of.\\n\\nIt's the bigger corporation that is sort of undersigning that approval for a loan.\\n\\nBecause I'm thinking corporation most of the time are standing on the Microsoft.\\n\\nSo we could try to make an Azure instance of GPT-4.\\n\\nThat's a wonderful idea.\\n\\nWe already have Azure set up.\\n\\nLet's look into that.\\n\\nI don't think that's the priority, but yes, let's definitely look into it because sooner\\n\\nor later we need to know what the f**k we're talking about.\\n\\nOkay, wonderful, wonderful.\\n\\nI mean, the mortgages probably don't do that, but because I have this automation for generating\\n\\nthe real estate listing, like description and stuff, they're doing something like this\\n\\nor not?\\n\\nAnd that's a great question and great observation too.\\n\\nThe mortgage lenders, no, but they have about 40 real estate agents on the team and those\\n\\nagents would want to do that.\\n\\nAnd most of the agents are not going to overlap in district.\\n\\nSo within, at least in the US, a city is not really a city.\\n\\nIt's a collection of districts.\\n\\nSo there is the center of the city and you might call the whole collection of districts\\n\\nthe same name as San Francisco, but there's a lot of districts around and real estate\\n\\nagents essentially belong to a district, to a certain district.\\n\\nSo most of these real estate agents don't overlap or not in competition with each other,\\n\\nwhich is wonderful.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to, hey, we came up with this service for creating great listings,\\n\\nlisting descriptions, here it is.\\n\\nThis is how much it costs.\\n\\nAnd they can all use it.\\n\\nThis is how much it costs per user, for example.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nAnd we can also automate the content generation in a similar way.\\n\\nAlso to the real estate, Realtor basically, because we've been doing one Realtor in the\\n\\nbeginning and we already have this priority map and we have a few ideas for things in\\n\\nthere.\\n\\nSo maybe we can touch on that or later we'll have a call with PaweÅ‚, he'll probably want\\n\\nto bring that up.\\n\\nAnd I actually have to bounce because we have the next meeting in about an hour.\\n\\nSo I'll have to bounce off and then we can continue this conversation on another call\\n\\nlater.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nDo you have to leave right now?\\n\\nLike five minutes.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nFive minutes is great.\\n\\nI just want to go over this real quickly and see if any of you have used any of these services\\n\\nbefore or programmed with any of these services before.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nTulio.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nSome knowledge.\\n\\nGreat.\\n\\nBartek, you said yes or no?\\n\\nI've been playing around a little bit with Make.com, but nothing serious.\\n\\nIt's more of like a dummy project.\\n\\nI don't know, Hubert, do you remember doing something with Tulio?\\n\\nOr it was Kamil doing that?\\n\\nOnce again?\\n\\nYou remember the yearly projects with Make.com we've been doing, you and Kamil, and then\\n\\none of you, I didn't remember which one, was doing something with Tulio.\\n\\nI don't think that we have the...\\n\\nIt was Kamil.\\n\\nTulio, it was Kamil.\\n\\nI mean, Tulio is more SMS, but the main thing is the regulations with SMS that you will\\n\\nneed to read up on the US stuff.\\n\\nUS tends to be lax with those things.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nI know Tulio in other countries has issues.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nMoving on.\\n\\nOpen phone, if it sounds familiar to anybody.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nBad, I will get the name of this, and probably not, but we'll just need to connect to it\\n\\nor send an email.\\n\\nOpus Pro, anybody?\\n\\nYeah, I've done my research on it.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nI think it's pretty easy.\\n\\nYeah, I've heard about it, and well, I found it and stuff, so.\\n\\nYeah, yeah, cool.\\n\\nYes, this is more of an automation.\\n\\nThis is just going to...\\n\\nIt is more cataloging who's familiar.\\n\\nZapier, who has done at least two automations with Zapier?\\n\\nWe are make.com fanboys.\\n\\nOkay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.\\n\\nBartek, Hubie.\\n\\nI prefer make.com as well.\\n\\nIt tends to be cheaper.\\n\\nThere's only certain things you want to use Zapier and make.com for.\\n\\nIf Zapier might connect with and follow up better than make.com, that's the only reason\\n\\nI'd choose.\\n\\nGreat.\\n\\nThat is some really good information.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nZapier, if necessary.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAnd then connecting to text messages will be, yeah.\\n\\nWe'll figure that out probably.\\n\\nIsn't that kind of Twilio?\\n\\nSo we have to look into...\\n\\nOkay, let me ask that question.\\n\\nWith Twilio, am I able to read messages or just send messages?\\n\\nI think you can.\\n\\nYeah, because you can read the messages.\\n\\nI'd have to check.\\n\\nI think you can use the API so that you can send the incoming message somewhere.\\n\\nSo that then tells me, oh, you can read the message, if that makes sense.\\n\\nOkay, wonderful.\\n\\nSo, Henry, if you can look into those details of Twilio.\\n\\nWhat's the use case, sorry, for reading text messages?\\n\\nOh, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nGreat question.\\n\\nSo the use case is going to be this.\\n\\nIs there a task to...\\n\\nIs there a task to complete?\\n\\nLet me simplify for now.\\n\\nIs there an appointment to set?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd how does it know whether to book one or not?\\n\\nIs it reading the message?\\n\\nAnd in the message, it says, hey, we should catch up next week.\\n\\nAnd then it knows.\\n\\nOr the AI is deciding it would be most valuable to connect up next week.\\n\\nThe AI would not be deciding if it's valuable to connect.\\n\\nIt will just read the messages.\\n\\nLunch next week?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nWednesday at 3 p.m. at wherever?\\n\\nGreat.\\n\\nWednesday at 3 p.m. at wherever would trigger now creating a calendar event.\\n\\nOh, yeah.\\n\\nSo we need a service that simply can read that message.\\n\\nAnd then we'll have...\\n\\nHonestly, in my mind comes an assistant that just reads the message.\\n\\nWhat might have to happen is...\\n\\nA few short prompting would probably be good enough.\\n\\nBut we'll see.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nI'm thinking we might have to redirect the messages to a new phone number.\\n\\nAnd then have them read from there.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nCool, cool, cool, cool.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nGreat, great.\\n\\nThat sounds plausible.\\n\\nLet me write that down here.\\n\\nRedirect messages.\\n\\nBecause she has a lot of texts.\\n\\n\\nso let's look into what the cost of that is and how if we would then include that into\\n\\nthe price or the price of the retainer.\\n\\nSo just if you can look at those two details regarding Tulio and would we need to redirect\\n\\nmessages and what would the price range be for that?\\n\\nOK, you can add me to your walkthrough.\\n\\nOh, wonderful, wonderful.\\n\\nOK, but that's me.\\n\\nYeah. Yeah, that's right.\\n\\nAwesome. Thank you, Kuba.\\n\\nNow, I'm going to look into Follow-Up Boss and look into adding a bunch of people, a bunch of leads inside of\\n\\nFollow-Up Boss so we can start doing things with it.\\n\\nOne question, oh, and we also already kind of have two referrals.\\n\\nSo that's good. One that already that needs to set up Follow-Up Boss and do the migration of leads and one that\\n\\nalready uses Follow-Up Boss and wants the next level, the automation.\\n\\nSo, yay.\\n\\nThis is exciting, you guys.\\n\\nWhat questions can I answer before we part into, Kuba wanted to look into into icebreakers and such, but what\\n\\nquestions can I answer right now?\\n\\nI think I don't have a question for now.\\n\\nI think we need to see the team.\\n\\nSo I was thinking we can also just send all messages to Twilio, to make.com and then have the just open AI call\\n\\nand, you know, filter from there.\\n\\nYeah. Yeah, that would definitely be one effective approach.\\n\\nBut on the other side, if she's sending so much text messages that are not all of them is like, you know, relevant,\\n\\nthen we would have a lot of operations on make, which might be quite costly.\\n\\nI mean, not that much, you know, just need to probably have some higher grade of subscription.\\n\\nBut we'll see how that goes later.\\n\\nGreat.\\n\\nThat's why I wanted to go into this in detail.\\n\\nShe might get 10 messages an hour for about 10 hours a day.\\n\\nIt's about 100 messages a day.\\n\\nI would be surprised if it was less.\\n\\nOK, we'll look into it.\\n\\nGood awareness. So.\\n\\nI'm thinking also about like, you know, for example, there could be a situation where she sends a message or two messages\\n\\nand I basically have to read them to as a one thread to understand the context.\\n\\nFor example, you know, one message stays a day and the other message stays the hour.\\n\\nSo I'm thinking that could be a risk in that, that\\n\\njust API call in make will just read one message and be out of context, kind of.\\n\\nI'm thinking mitigating that could be and also mitigating the cost could be if she just,\\n\\nthat will require some future automation, because I was thinking if she can make screenshot and then we can set automation to send that to GPT Vision.\\n\\nThat makes you make screenshot when she have the, you know, the meeting in those texts.\\n\\nSo we are meeting all the not meeting texts.\\n\\nBut at that point, we're looking at her pictures.\\n\\nAnd I don't think that that actually let's let's keep the ideas going.\\n\\nLet's definitely keep the ideas going.\\n\\nIf there's a way to compile last four messages, for example, from a certain person.\\n\\nSo let's look into Tulio first.\\n\\nAnd then we'll go through through branches of risks and solutions.\\n\\nYeah. Yeah. Cool.\\n\\nSo Henry and Cuba.\\n\\nWe're going to Tulio.\\n\\nI'll look into follow up boss.\\n\\nAnd for now, Cuba, let's keep going on the on the outreach.\\n\\nI'll stick around and we can talk about it.\\n\\nAnd Bartek, well, what does your time look like today and the next few days?\\n\\nI know we're talking in an hour, but what does your time look like?\\n\\nToday, I'm already fully booked.\\n\\nSorry, I meant like Monday and Tuesday more.\\n\\nLet me see that in the calendar.\\n\\nI got some calls in Tuesday and Wednesday.\\n\\nBesides that, I'm quite, quite, quite free.\\n\\nCool. Cool.\\n\\nSo we'll get to work on Monday on some of the details and we can actually get a prototype probably just straight up Monday.\\n\\nSo we have follow up boss.\\n\\nYou guys, this is really cool.\\n\\nYeah. Yeah, I'm glad you find it cool.\\n\\nUm, uh, Paige and I are moving to the other side of the world, um, tomorrow.\\n\\nUh, so we'll, we'll be around for on Monday for, for all the meetings and whatever.\\n\\nSo fortunately we're traveling through the weekend.\\n\\nHowever, um, we were evaluating if what times would work best for you.\\n\\nUh, because we won't have anybody in the Americas.\\n\\nUh, in fact, um, I've got a last minute up there as well.\\n\\nUm, basically my, my dad's now like got a job, but he's not starting until like a next month.\\n\\nSo he wanted to go do something.\\n\\nSo I'm actually flying to Thailand on Monday.\\n\\nDude also means we're in the same time zone.\\n\\nThat's awesome.\\n\\nSingapore.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nWe're going to, I think it's four hours difference between Singapore to Sydney.\\n\\nSo that'll, that'll work for us a lot better.\\n\\nHow long are you staying in?\\n\\nHow long are you traveling for?\\n\\nMaybe two, two, two and a half weeks.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nYes, I know.\\n\\nYup.\\n\\nYup.\\n\\nSo, so I'll share, I'll share some questions that we can, we can figure out probably some, uh, better, uh, times that work for, for people.\\n\\nUm, but anyway, we'll figure that out, that part out.\\n\\nUm,\\n\\nit also does mean I'm probably going to be, I will, I will make it, I will bring my laptop and I will work, but it will probably be about a bit.\\n\\nAnd then, yeah, today's really my last day to like work on this before Wednesday, probably.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nUm, great.\\n\\nSo let's, um,\\n\\nokay.\\n\\nWe'll, we'll come back to that in a second.\\n\\nUm, Henry, um,\\n\\nCuba, how are you doing my brother?\\n\\nWhere's my audio jam, bro?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nAs you can see, I'm doing fantastic.\\n\\nUm, curious.\\n\\nUm, what's the update on the, uh, relevance integration into the script?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nUm, it's works, but, but, um, currently, um, the project is going in another direction.\\n\\nSo I figure out that Landgraf would be like the best right now.\\n\\nSo we need to like, like we create everything with Landgraf because, um, we need like your outlier because when, like, it could come\\n\\ncomes in, we need like an LLM as I like as a router for the question.\\n\\nSo it's kind of like direct the question to the right agent.\\n\\nDo you understand what I'm trying to say?\\n\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nIt can like walk in a loop.\\n\\nSo that's what I'm trying to like figure out at the moment.\\n\\nSo, well, I tried out, I tried out the relevancy API and it works well, but the only problem right now is the email prompt.\\n\\nWhich is like, it's like taking so much of like, um,\\n\\n\\nthe course is very rare, I mean I tried the prompt template, so I need to address that\\n\\nfirst.\\n\\nOkay, so you're talking about, let me share a screen and you can show me which portion\\n\\nyou're talking about.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nYou mean for like email draft?\\n\\nYep.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nLike break the email?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nBreakers.\\n\\nAnd then.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nHere.\\n\\nYeah, those prompt templates.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nDo you use Langsmith?\\n\\nLike, have you tried?\\n\\nI have not.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLangsmith is just like for debugging and like checking token cost.\\n\\nSo when I checked, this is costing like about almost a dollar, so we need to like refine\\n\\nthe prompt to like make it better and.\\n\\nWait, so only this is costing a dollar is what you're saying?\\n\\nYeah, almost a dollar.\\n\\nOh, okay.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nIs that with the output as well?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nThis is for last month.\\n\\nCan you just show me last month?\\n\\nPlease show me last month.\\n\\nHere we go.\\n\\nSo these were like four or five runs of that event, of that script.\\n\\nIs this what you're saying?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCan you go to Langsmith?\\n\\nJust log into Langsmith.\\n\\nOkay, I'm using my API.\\n\\nI need to share my screen.\\n\\nGive me a minute.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nYeah, that's cool.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nMessage.\\n\\nNice.\\n\\nI'm getting a message from his computer.\\n\\nYeah, that's cool.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThere you go.\\n\\nNo, not yet.\\n\\nYeah, it's loading.\\n\\nYeah. Okay.\\n\\nYes, so this is what I'm talking about.\\n\\nSo I can see the agents that I can see all my workflow here.\\n\\nSo for that draft an email.\\n\\n32,000 tokens from what?\\n\\nSometimes, I guess, I guess it's just the agents will be just sometimes like spin off.\\n\\nCan you can you see what percent of the tokens are the output what percent of the tokens are the prompt.\\n\\nWell, we have the prompt, so.\\n\\nOh, but it has like the question input and then the agent scratch pad.\\n\\nSummarize.\\n\\nWe're going to optimize the knowledge base because that's not very effective.\\n\\nOh, nice.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nYep.\\n\\nSo this is the output of the.\\n\\nWhere's the email.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI'm sorry. This was like the question that I asked. So this is the amount of tokens for each of it. So for the email output.\\n\\nI think it should be.\\n\\nOkay, so for that one for that one prompt, which is the numbers of the 1800.\\n\\nThat amount of tokens are consumed.\\n\\nYeah. Okay. Well, you know, you know, like when you're using an agent, like it's breaking the tax step by step, step by step.\\n\\nSo let's from the beginning.\\n\\nFor me, this is the input. My input was dropped on email using like a summarized version of our knowledge base.\\n\\nYes, this is the output.\\n\\nSo 1300 tokens is what the input was.\\n\\nAnd then the whole step by step of breaking down the action input observation.\\n\\nAnd running the step by step of the Lang chain.\\n\\nThen that in total was 32,000. Is that what we're saying here?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nDoes that include like icebreakers and all that stuff? Or is this purely just that one step of drafting the email?\\n\\nJust the step of using our summarized knowledge base.\\n\\nSo what we're using now is the prompt, the icebreaker, the output from the icebreakers and summarized version of our knowledge base.\\n\\nAnd then we're going to run the step by step of breaking down the action input observation.\\n\\nAnd then running the step by step of the Lang chain.\\n\\nAnd then the whole step by step of the icebreaker.\\n\\nAnd then we're going to run the step by step of the Lang chain.\\n\\n\\nOkay, and what you're proposing for minimising token usage is changing to\\n\\nline graph. No, no, no, no, no, line graph is just like, line graph is just like routing, like, questions, when you, like,\\n\\nwhen an input is sent to an element, to route it to the right agent, you don't need, like,\\n\\ncan perform loop with the tools, like, you just need to give it the input, it knows, like, the\\n\\ntool that it's going to use, because of its ability. Gotcha. Yeah. So, line graph is just,\\n\\nit's just a better way to route agents, like, making it more autonomous, something like,\\n\\nthereabouts. So, yeah, but we need to, like, fix this prompt to be more effective and, like,\\n\\nminimise the cost of the tokens. Yes, we definitely do. Okay.\\n\\nIt's cool. I'm thinking of something, I'll try that and give it back to you, just, like, giving\\n\\nyou all the tools. Sounds good. I do really want us to prioritise making sure that, well, let me,\\n\\nlet me just double check and backtrack a second. I'm looking at the icebreakers.\\n\\nWe have five icebreakers. Professionally relevant, interest-based,\\n\\nadaptive communication style. Cool. Timely and relevant icebreaker,\\n\\nsuggestive of collaboration icebreaker. So, the icebreaker seems to, like, be writing,\\n\\nnot a whole email, but it is going for the congratulations on the release of whatever.\\n\\nIt's an impressive and collaborative effort. Could you elaborate on how this dataset could\\n\\nbe learning and multimodal perception? We might want to start choosing a real estate agent to\\n\\nask more relevant questions to what we're actually going to do, but could we set up a time to discuss\\n\\nthis further? Okay. Now comes the portion that we talked about. I'm going to share a screen real\\n\\nquick. Hey, guys, I have to bounce now. Okay. Sounds good. We'll see you later, Huy. Now comes\\n\\nthis portion of introducing the human. We have some icebreakers. We'll run it a few times with\\n\\ndifferent people. We'll collect those icebreakers and then actually evaluate. So, I'll get together\\n\\nwith Zach, and we can look at it. We can set up some time and actually go through a bunch of\\n\\nicebreakers. It feels to me that if we're going to do this in an organized, systematic manner,\\n\\nwe're going to need Airtable. So, uploading these to the Airtable base that we created\\n\\nso we can actually look at them one by one and have notes of what we would change.\\n\\nI'm thinking aloud here. Human here, upload icebreakers to Airtable. We can have a table\\n\\nof icebreakers, and then we can fine-tune starting from the icebreakers. The concern\\n\\nthat you bring up for tokens is a super valid concern, and we have the options of changing the\\n\\nmodel. We also have the option of changing the prompt to make it smaller so that at every step\\n\\nthat it gets processed, it's not consuming a multiplicative amount of tokens. That might come\\n\\nthrough optimizing the knowledge base first, kind of like creating the summary of the knowledge base\\n\\nfirst, because the knowledge base tells a whole story, and we don't need the whole story.\\n\\nWe just need, objectively, this is how we're involved, this is our offer, this is what we\\n\\noffer, and this is the ideal customer profile that we're going for. So, knowledge base,\\n\\nsummary, should only contain ICP, our offer, and ethos of the organization. Amplify the human.\\n\\nAnd this could just be, this could be just a whole summary. We might give it a little more,\\n\\nbut let's start there. So, we'll create a summary of the knowledge base, and that will, number one,\\n\\nhelp with reducing token usage and not having the model have to go through so much information,\\n\\nwe'll just confuse it. What other thoughts come to mind?\\n\\nSo, I'm thinking of refining the prompt. Okay. Email prompt. I'm thinking of refining it.\\n\\nAnd is that shortening?\\n\\nI can't see shortening. I think, like, creating it from, like, the beginning, but I'm thinking\\n\\nto be implementing some things from PFE, from this one that we're using, but really, like,\\n\\nbuilding it from scratch. So, I'll just try, I'll try out a lot of, like, iterations and\\n\\nsee what works out well. Okay. Sounds good. I think I'm going to look at this icebreaker prompt\\n\\nand probably change a few things, not much. I think this is pretty straightforward and effective.\\n\\nWe just need to go test it with our actual ideal customer profile.\\n\\nWe just need to go test it with our actual ideal customer profile, real estate agents,\\n\\nand we're working on that with the sales team. There also came the other question of, like,\\n\\nhey, what framework of email do we use? So, we'll be integrating that as well.\\n\\nMaybe that's something that helps guide this a bit more. Like, hey, here is the framework.\\n\\nOkay. Kuba, can we make sure that this gets uploaded to the GitHub?\\n\\nYeah, sure. Sure.\\n\\nWe can create a repository. I'll create a repository and\\n\\nI'll come in.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOh, that's cool. I didn't know they had this.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm getting distracted.\\n\\nSo, we have personalized outreach system. I'm adding you guys in here.\\n\\nI'm going to security.\\n\\nSettings, collaborators. Great.\\n\\nAnd we have\\n\\nrate for members.\\n\\nCan you guys see if you can get here?\\n\\n\\nYeah, I'm in the GitHub.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nWhere exactly are you looking?\\n\\nOh, just the Personalised Outreach System, if you can see it.\\n\\nYeah, I'm in it.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAnd Kuba, you too?\\n\\nOh, yes, I'm coming.\\n\\nAwesome, awesome.\\n\\nSo, that's where we're going to update everything.\\n\\nSo, if you could start with this initial commit, and then we'll go forward.\\n\\nThere's definitely some to-do's.\\n\\nKuba, what's your GitHub username?\\n\\nKuba, K-U-B-A. Let me send my open to K-U-B-A.\\n\\nOh, really?\\n\\nCool, man.\\n\\nUpload icebreakers to Airtable.\\n\\nOptimise email draft token usage.\\n\\nOh, okay, wait.\\n\\nI'm going to remove Ahmed, because we only have four seats.\\n\\nOh, I see.\\n\\nYep, yep.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nGreat.\\n\\nIt deleted what I wrote.\\n\\nHave you heard from Ahmed?\\n\\nYeah, I did.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI also do...\\n\\nNan messaged me last night.\\n\\nOh, cool.\\n\\nSaying he's fine and stuff.\\n\\nOh, yeah, he just made it back to France.\\n\\nHe messaged me too.\\n\\nOh, very awesome.\\n\\nOptimise token usage on email draft.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo...\\n\\nOh, wait.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nKuba, can you drop your email address to the GitHub in the chat?\\n\\nTo your GitHub account.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo...\\n\\n$10 for a million tokens.\\n\\n$30 for a million tokens.\\n\\nSo that's 3 cents for 1,000 tokens.\\n\\nFor output, 1 cent for 1,000 tokens.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, yes, we definitely want to be using this.\\n\\nHowever, if we're talking GPT-4...\\n\\nOh, what?\\n\\nGPT-4 Turbo?\\n\\nOh, bro, we got to be using GPT-4 Turbo.\\n\\nAre we not?\\n\\nIt's like half the cost.\\n\\nIt's a third of the cost, yeah.\\n\\nAnd then GPT-3.5 Turbo, if we...\\n\\nYeah, they're making them cheaper as well.\\n\\nIt's crazy.\\n\\nIt's absurd.\\n\\nYeah, I've sent it.\\n\\nIt's in the chat.\\n\\nYep.\\n\\nI found you.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nSo I'm just going to go update the model real quick.\\n\\nI didn't realize you weren't using Turbo.\\n\\nI would have said something, sorry.\\n\\nOh, but we found out now.\\n\\nAnd that's what's important.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nI'll send you an invitation.\\n\\nIt might be in your email.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nI'll check it now.\\n\\nAnd this is the organization called FastRise GitHub, yeah?\\n\\nYep.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nSo GPT-4, preview, preview.\\n\\nKuba, if I run this whole thing, then you would be able to look at that same analysis of token cost.\\n\\nYeah?\\n\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, sure.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nI added you as a collaborator, so yes.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nYes, because we, yes, because you, yep, yep, yep.\\n\\nI'm going to connect and then run all.\\n\\nOkay, let's see what happens.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo this will be slow.\\n\\nThat's something that we'll have to work with.\\n\\nAnd it's fine because this is not time limited, fortunately.\\n\\nAs we prepare leads to send emails for a campaign, we have time to prepare them.\\n\\nEven just running it overnight is good enough.\\n\\nSo don't be too concerned about that part.\\n\\nAnd we will optimize over time.\\n\\nAll right, cool.\\n\\nYep.\\n\\nAnd yeah, the other thing is LinkedIn profile URLs.\\n\\nMost of the time we'll have it, not always.\\n\\nSo it's great that you left that in there.\\n\\nWe'll keep using it.\\n\\nAnd.\\n\\nYeah, I was about to ask about that.\\n\\nI saw your comment about it before.\\n\\nOh, yeah.\\n\\nI didn't get like what you're trying to say.\\n\\nOh, okay.\\n\\nWhich one?\\n\\nThis one or this one?\\n\\nAbout the LinkedIn URL.\\n\\nOh, yeah.\\n\\nSo for some of our lead lists, the LinkedIn URL will already be available.\\n\\nSo this step where we're doing the SERP for finding the.\\n\\nNo, it's not SERP.\\n\\nWe're doing the search of the LinkedIn URL.\\n\\nThis step would need to be skipped because we already have the LinkedIn URL.\\n\\nSo how does this flow change when we don't actually need to do this step?\\n\\nSo.\\n\\nAnd.\\n\\nSorry.\\n\\nSo this is where long graph comes in.\\n\\nSo.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWe use like an LLM as like a router.\\n\\nInstead of like.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nIn a case where we have only the LinkedIn URL.\\n\\nThe LLM router knows that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nIt's not going to use.\\n\\nIt's not going to be directed to this agent.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo instead we're going straight to.\\n\\nThis.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\nYeah, so, so, you are not using, we are not going to use like this agent. Do you understand?\\n\\nLike the router agent, we are going to create an agent that does the routing for each question.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nIf you input a LinkedIn link, so you know you are asking, you are skipping this agent, you are going to, the right agent that you are looking for. Do you understand?\\n\\nYes, I do. I understand. I guess my question is, so right now and for the near future, the critic will be set in different places, right?\\n\\nHere, there is another critic here, there is another critic here. And there is probably one loop that happens.\\n\\nHowever, it is mostly sequential. In fact, this loop is just a sequence where we put the email writer here and then the email gets sent.\\n\\nSo, since it is sequential and the LinkedIn profile, whether we have a LinkedIn profile or not, is pretty binary. It comes from a variable.\\n\\nWould we really need a whole agent, a whole routing agent to decide what step comes next? Or can we just do an, hey, if this variable is filled in this lead list, in this spreadsheet, in the CSV, then do this step.\\n\\nIf not, then do that step. Is there another purpose to the routing agent?\\n\\nNo, no, no, no, no. That works too, at least. That works. It makes things much easier.\\n\\nOkay. My ideal, in my ideal view, what you said, yes, it applies. There is a critic that will, whatever, do an assessment of the icebreakers and then say, hey, you know what, let's go back to the icebreakers step because none of these are good.\\n\\nIdeally, that's something that happens. For now, for a V1, let's keep it sequential. Let's keep it code and, in a way, reducing, minimizing the amount of agents that we're using, even as we're using like 10 different agents.\\n\\nOkay. So I'm with you on the application. Let's keep it simple for now. Let's keep it programmatic. And as soon as I can, I will give you a CSV of what that actually looks like, of what those leads actually look like.\\n\\nAnd when that LinkedIn profile column, that data is there or it's not. Yes, this is the LinkedIn URL, or it's empty. If it's empty, then run this step. Yeah, run this step. So we'll get around to that. For now, what you're doing here is wonderful.\\n\\nAnd we will decide for the next step, check if the leads CSV contains a LinkedIn profile URL.\\n\\nIf it doesn't, skip next step.\\n\\nIf it does, make LinkedIn profile URL equal to whatever, data frame, which has the same name, LinkedIn profile URL. Okay. Cool.\\n\\nAnd as we're looping through the people in this data frame, in the CSV, we can actually play with the variables inside and all that stuff. And we'll integrate the Instantly API later.\\n\\nYeah. Anyway, I think we're on the same page about that. Anything else to note? Anything else I should look at here?\\n\\nI think that should be all for now.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI'm going to try running this one more time.\\n\\nAnd we are also not right now. You're comfortable. If you're comfortable with Google Colab, that's great.\\n\\nWe'll just make sure we have a version of it in the GitHub. And we are going to transition to, unless you can have GitHub. Yeah, yeah. Save a copy to GitHub. Okay, great.\\n\\nAs long as we're clicking on that. So good. Just can't see the organization.\\n\\nWhy not? Because it's not public? Is that a problem?\\n\\nI can see it here.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI just can't see the organization here, which is weird.\\n\\nI can't see FastRice.\\n\\nWhy not? Because it's not public? Is that why? Because it's not public?\\n\\nI can see it here.\\n\\nOkay. Anyway, that's a neat thing.\\n\\nWe can move it to Visual Studio Code or something.\\n\\nMy point is, whatever you're comfortable coding is fine, as long as we have an updated version of it in GitHub every time. And I can just be using Visual Studio that I feel comfortable with. And I can be running it there. So it works.\\n\\nI just actually built it out using Colabo. Yeah, I'll move it over to Visual Studio Code. Then I can just pull in from the GitHub repo.\\n\\nOkay, sounds good.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nAnd just going to change the name too, just so we're on the same page.\\n\\nAnd let me run the rest of this.\\n\\nJust want to have you here while I run this.\\n\\nOh, I have another meeting.\\n\\nOkay, cool. Beautiful. Very readable.\\n\\nOh, it's still running. Okay.\\n\\nTo assess the relevance and potential alignment with our company's strategic goals in the AI sector, expertise, experience, and interests against the backdrop of our company.\\n\\nAI sector, you will always carefully review information of the person.\\n\\nAssess how significant a person is in artificial intelligence.\\n\\nOkay, we will also, I'll work on tuning that prompt.\\n\\nJust so we're on smoother.\\n\\nBut it's good. It's good.\\n\\nAnd down here, we put a step, part of the to-do list.\\n\\nThen we talked about optimized qualifier prompt.\\n\\nI also looked at uploading to Airtable for human review.\\n\\nSync with GitHub.\\n\\nLatest version accessible to everyone.\\n\\n\\nLovely. Okay. Great. Thank you, you guys. Oh, yeah. Checking this, checking this. Ran,\\n\\nLinkedIn profile, LinkedIn data. No, no, no, no. That should be deleted. I'll delete it. This is,\\n\\nthis is what, this is for like when I was using this proxy call. Yes, that's right. That's right.\\n\\nSo I'm going to delete it. That's why I moved everything down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So this,\\n\\nand then, then it finished. Okay. If you can just upload a version that includes this,\\n\\nmaybe with a comment. I want us to have different available options. And this could, this worked,\\n\\nit worked. So having that code somewhere in the code base, it's just going to be a good idea\\n\\noverall. Okay. Great. Okay. The email draft agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nDo you know what that's about?\\n\\nYeah, that was when I was like running the, the email. Did you just run this one now?\\n\\nYeah. Yeah. I just ran it just now. Oh, okay. Let me see it. I need to bring down the email\\n\\ninto a smaller section.\\n\\nDid you, the input of the email, did you run the like email block?\\n\\nYes. Yep. Okay. So\\n\\nlet me see.\\n\\nWeird.\\n\\nOkay. I have to go to a meeting. I'll, I'll leave you with that. And\\n\\nwhy is he writing John Doe?\\n\\nJohn Doe is just like Laura Hampson.\\n\\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why, why that changed though. When would it have changed John?\\n\\nIt's the only time it shows up. It just.\\n\\nUnless the LLM model automatically names it John Doe.\\n\\nYeah. Yeah. Maybe. If you can look into that on your side, Kuba.\\n\\nThen I'll check it out.\\n\\nYeah. Great. Wonderful. Any questions that come up, clarification, please hit me up and, and,\\n\\nand we can, we can make sure we have it done, but these are the to-dos. If there's any confusion at\\n\\nall, we can talk about it. Check iteration limit\\n\\nerror on critic and check John Doe instead of Yann LeCun. I believe it's on, on icebreakers.\\n\\nNo, on, on email. Cool. You guys let's have a great rest of your day.\\n\\nYeah. Did you want to talk about the Thailand thing? I know you said something.\\n\\nYes, I do. And I have a meeting with Bartik and Powell. Sorry for, sorry that I kept you here.\\n\\nLet's talk about it later. Essentially what I'm saying is like you're with your dad,\\n\\nobviously enjoy your time. And as things speed up, we'll also like make sure that we give you\\n\\nvery specific, clear tasks so you can organize yourself.\\n\\nThat's it. Then that's fine. Yeah, no, I totally get it.\\n\\nCool. Thank you. Thanks for everything. Appreciate it.\\n\\nYeah. Yeah. My pleasure. It's time to, time to accelerate. Let's do this.\\n\\nAll right. Peace out, man.\\n\\nBye guys.\\n\\nPaige, let's meet in a different link. I'll send it to you.\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\meeting_transcript.txt'})]\n"
