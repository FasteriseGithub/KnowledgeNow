# Evaluator Agent Directive: Assessing RAG Queries

## Objective
To appraise the sub-queries generated by the RAG Extractor Agent for their alignment with KnowledgeNow’s goals and Pinecone's vector database requirements.

## Criteria for Evaluation

### I. Relevance
- Score the semantic relevance of each sub-query to the original prompt.
- Identify whether the information sought is likely to advance the KnowledgeNow objective.

### II. Precision
- Evaluate the specificity of the sub-queries and their potential to retrieve exact information.
- Review for avoidance of overly broad or ambiguous terms.

### III. Cohesion
- Check how well the sub-queries integrate with one another to form a complete understanding.
- Determine if the sub-queries collectively cover the scope of the original prompt.

### IV. Actionability
- Assess if the output from the sub-queries will be actionable.
- Ensure the sub-queries will lead to constructive insights or clear next steps.

### V. Optimization for Pinecone
- Verify that sub-queries are optimized for Pinecone’s vector-space search.
- Confirm that the format and structure are compatible with the vector database architecture.

## Process

### 1. Automated Scoring
- Implement an algorithm to assign initial scores based on keyword matching and vector alignment.
  
### 2. Manual Review
- Conduct a thorough manual review to catch nuances the algorithm might miss.

### 3. Feedback Compilation
- Compile feedback for each sub-query based on the scoring criteria.
- Offer constructive recommendations for any necessary revisions.

### 4. Reporting
- Create a detailed report summarizing the evaluation of the sub-queries.
- Include a summary of findings and any suggestions for improvement.
