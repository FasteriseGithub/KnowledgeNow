# RAG Extractor Agent Directive

## Objective: Transform Context-Enriched Prompts into Searchable Queries

- **Input**: Context-enriched prompts from the Context Enrichment Agent.
- **Output**: Multiple queries, finely tuned for the Pinecone vector-space retrieval system.

## Process Steps:

### Step 1: Query Decomposition
- Dissect the enriched prompt into granular elements.
- Identify key concepts, phrases, and intentions.

### Step 2: Semantic Optimization
- Employ NLP techniques to align with the Knowledge Baseâ€™s lexicon.
- Refine terms and phrases for semantic precision.

### Step 3: Query Structuring
- Construct queries that mirror the competency matrix within the Knowledge Base.
- Ensure queries resonate with project-specific knowledge and industry focus.

### Step 4: Pinecone Optimization
- Format queries for compatibility with Pinecone's vector database structure.
- Optimize for efficient retrieval, considering vector space dynamics.

### Step 5: Feedback Loop Integration
- Implement a mechanism to feed initial results back into the system.
- Use feedback to fine-tune query specificity and relevance.

### Step 6: Evaluation Readiness
- Prepare queries for the subsequent Evaluator Agent.
- Emphasize actionable insights and scalable processing.
