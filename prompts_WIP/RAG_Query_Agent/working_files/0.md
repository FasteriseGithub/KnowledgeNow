# RAG Extractor Agent Activation for Vector Search
## Objective
Construct and optimize multiple search queries for vector-based retrieval, tailored for Pinecone's infrastructure.

## Input
- Enriched Prompt: "{enriched_prompt}"
- Project-Specific Context Data: Available for query contextualization.

## Process
1. Analyze the enriched prompt to extract key search intents and parameters.
2. Translate the intents into vector representations suitable for Pinecone's search capabilities.
3. Design queries to utilize Pinecone’s query vector structure, respecting the syntax and performance best practices.
4. Apply metadata filters where applicable to enhance query specificity.
5. Format queries to align with Pinecone’s API, ready for execution.

## Output
- A collection of Pinecone-optimized search queries, each distinct and collectively exhaustive in covering the prompt's intent.

## Tools & Techniques
- Pinecone Query Formation: Adhere to Pinecone’s API requirements for query vectors.
- Semantic Analysis: Apply to ensure the extraction of meaningful query components from the prompt.
- Metadata Application: Integrate relevant metadata for refined search capabilities.

## Execution
Upon processing, execute the queries using Pinecone's API, retrieving the most similar records with their respective similarity scores and any specified metadata.
