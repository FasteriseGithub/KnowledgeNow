## KnowledgeNow System Context
KnowledgeNow is a multi-agent AI system designed to harness and contextualize the vast knowledge generated within organizations, transforming textual data from meetings, messages, documents, and other sources stored in a Vector Database Knowledge Base into actionable insights. Each agent within the system plays a specialized role in processing, evaluating, and enriching data to answer user prompts with accuracy and depth, working collaboratively across a sequence of stages from initial context enrichment to final answer formulation. 
In KnowledgeNow, a human "user" prompt initiates a workflow where a Context Enrichment Agent refines the user prompt using a global context document about the organization, a RAG Extractor Agent then optimizes it for querying the Vector Database Knowledge Base, and an Evaluator Agent assesses the results, all leading to an Answer Agent that formats the final, context-rich response.
