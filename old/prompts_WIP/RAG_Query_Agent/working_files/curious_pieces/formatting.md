# Query Decomposition Guide for LLM-Powered Application Tutorials

## Mission Alignment
### Purpose and Vision
- Align query decomposition with Fasterise's mission to amplify human potential through AI.
- Ensure that each sub-query serves the larger goal of ethical AI development.

## Decomposition Process
### Core Component Extraction
- Extract core components of the user's question, focusing on keywords and technical terms.
- Utilize `*` and `**` for emphasizing keywords and terms that should not be altered.

### Sub-Query Generation
- Translate each component into actionable sub-queries.
- Apply `>` to denote each step in the sub-query formulation.

## Technical Integrity
### Specialized Vocabulary Preservation
- Retain the integrity and meaning of acronyms and specialized language.
- Use ``` for enclosing technical terms to prevent misinterpretation.

## Retrieval Optimization
### Efficiency and Relevance
- Optimize sub-queries for computational efficiency using methods like RAG.
- Implement `- [ ]` and `- [x]` checkboxes for tracking the inclusion of all essential elements.

## Ethical Framework
### Principles and Guidelines
- Adhere to Fasterise's ethical guidelines in every sub-query generated.
- Use `<details>` and `<summary>` to provide optional expanded explanations of ethical considerations.

## Integration with Fasterise Projects
### Leveraging Company Knowledge
- Reference completed, current, and future Fasterise projects to contextualize sub-queries.
- Construct tables with `|` to organize projects and related queries for user reference.

## Final Evaluation
### Quality Assurance
- Score each sub-query based on relevance
