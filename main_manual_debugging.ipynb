I was just talking to my dad and I was basically saying about the Zoom knowledge base thing and he brought up a good point, was Microsoft Copilot. It can do that a lot with a lot of the teams, all the teams calls. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry, do what? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo Microsoft Copilot can ask it, like who contributes the most on the calls about profit sharing. That's one of the features of Microsoft Copilot. So Copilot already has this knowledge base. So that is a competitor to think about. So then do that. And to what extent do Microsoft have that? So that's something we should probably look into is copilot. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGood call. Very good call. Yeah, we have access to the full Microsoft ecosystem, including code pilot through the founders hub. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nKnow, we could probably move everything to teams then. But do we want to? Because right now we're doing Zoom and discord. Or it could all be in Microsoft Teams. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's true. It would be a transition for everyone. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I think for now I don't want to do any more sort of, hey, this would be admin. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBefore we. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nGet a client because right now that would be a 5% better thing where we need to focus on the things that can get us 50% better. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's a very good point. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHave you figured out the LinkedIn scripture issue? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI did, actually. Kind of. There's progress. Let me show you. We have three options. This is the one that I was looking at yesterday. Maybe they emailed me back. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThere'S bright data them, there's relevance AI apparently, and phantom busters. And I love relevance. So we good start there for an initial build and it's very easy to integrate into GPT, which is the really cool part. How much have you played with relevance? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI played with. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry, suddenly I can't quite hear you. Okay, there we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's see. We're talking tools, templates. LinkedIn scraper is how compatible job candidate improve LinkedIn post company research. Scrape Lincoln's profile. Get someone's professional data from LinkedIn profile. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo we get an about section. We get followers count, full name headline hqcDHQ country where are you? Okay, so this does not contain posts education experiences. More companies, more companies. Okay, and now we're getting user posts. But you see how this is an agent by itself, which has actions that it can do. It just doesn't get to choose which actions it does. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe're absolutely over the moon. We have broken ground and snowman apartment is going ahead. So they're building new apartments for this ski place. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTwo years ago. So this is probably not our guy for the posts part. What we would like to do. Oh, it gets like a bunch of posts. This is not using LinkedIn credits, I believe. Yeah, no, this is not using LinkedIn credits. This LLM step so we want to say, bartech, I might need your help in here. I have LinkedIn full one. Let's call it LinkedIn posts. This is the profile and these are the posts. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHow can I append a JSon to the next tool to the previous one? How can I append LinkedIn posts to LinkedIn full? See, like I need to run this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I get the answers and now filter and I need to write. So I have LinkedIn posts. You have created a string by adding multiple variables. So how do I make this into one object? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo you need both, right? You need full data and post data both. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo what about, you can make two steps like this, like clone this step or something and have them separate. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's true. Yeah. So I can say, hey, LinkedIn post data, this parameter requires an object, just a list of any. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe want to return this returns return object and then this returns list. So I say outputs should be. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, now I'm getting it. So, so it's going to grab a list. No, this returns an object. That's strange. What's the big difference here? URL, get user posts. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI want us to make sure that we can use this because it's a very important thing moving forward. So when you get profile, it returns an object. So then you're talking that this action getuser profile returns always an object. That's just how they coded it, which is fine. Get user posts is going to return a list. So we wouldn't need to extract JSOn fields from it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nReturns list is just pass it in the right format to the LLM. So instead of filtering JSon by field, what I'd like to do is I'd like for it to be python data. Combine array of strings, filter jSon by fields, combine array. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLinkedIn full is returning a json. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, so I'm going to add python code. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd now I have a variable called LinkedIn posts. So LinkedIn posts should exist. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I want to get the, let's say, latest three posts. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLinkedIn posts is a thing. It already exists. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI'm wondering about the cost. You said it's way cheaper in this relevance because when I check it ago, it was quite expensive. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n$20 gives you 10,000 credits and getting a profile and parsing it is going to be about the same amount of credits than the other options that were looking at cost. But they give you 2500 credits for like what, $50? And this is like 10,000 credits for $20.Speaker 5\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I don't know what happening. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI also have a question about actual scraping because they have like scraper off of their own kind of on their build or this is some kind of, I don't know, LinkedIn API. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThey built their own scraper essentially. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI want it standard out. Okay, so data. Oh, I have to go into LinkedIn post data. So it is an object. That's strange. Come on. It's an object. Is it a dictionary that it's. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet'S see. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTuki tuki tuki. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTuki tuki. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd there we go. It gets the first three LinkedIn posts. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt does not get the first link. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNumber of comments post URL posted on posted LinkedIn URL text. So I want to get to this field. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis field. Okay, this is it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nData, recent posts. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRecent posts. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWould be the first three elements. And of the first three elements we just want text and kind of how long ago? So I'm going to say from data, give me. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nText and I kind. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOf want like how long ago am I able to, I've never done this before. Am I able to say like this in a dictionary to give me these. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTwo fields. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nText and time? I don't think this is valid. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, must be integers, not tuple. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, so we're going the other way. Data text. We're just getting one. So what am I doing here? We're going to, the data is just the placeholder first post and give me just the text. So this is his latest post. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, let's just move forward. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo we're getting this. It's part of this element. Recent posts. We are deleting this step. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe don't need it anymore. And we're expanding. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe haven't run this LinkedIn full data, though. I'm going to run it all at the same time. And just return no relevant info. Do not make things up. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWait, what? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nInclude specially recent experiences in the summary. If there is no relevant information about. Just no relevant info. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Do not make things up. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBo is a LinkedIn profile of potential prospect called Bam. Can you please help me summarize this person's profile? Include specially recent experiences in the summary. And it's given this JSON filtered. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nProfile. Recent posts. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI called it recent posts. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI believe this is the right way to do it. Let's run all of it and see. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat happens. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd all before my computer dies. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, the user profile gets saved into LinkedIn full. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLinkedIn full. Whoa. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet me rearrange. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis. Okay. Weird. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGetting the user profile. I just really want us to unblock this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf I'm killing time, please let me know. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is weird. It was working right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAbout. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExperiences it. It experiences. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nVery strange. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt was working. Not quite working right now. And I'm going to call it done for now and we'll get the whole thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nProperly. Does this need the data thing? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, well, let's move forward. We have some other options. I think that I'm going to make sure that I make this work, you guys. And we can call it. We can also create an action for this from a GPT. What are next steps. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFor me? I'm going to look into some of the autogen stuff a bit more. Then there's some stuff I want to play around. And then it'd be. I think what I'll do is I'll focus on creating the other agents to go around, like the checker that checks it and the flow, and then just plugging in the relevance, if we need to, into the cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOne, the Roger. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDilemma two. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat are some next steps? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo, since we're using relevance, I'm thinking of using the first agent that is getting the LinkedIn details and the outreach agency getting the LinkedIn data and. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExtracting. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe right information from it before building the second one. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCan we. Yeah, sorry. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCan we hop on a call later to just write up this message? And then we'll take like ten minutes. Five minutes? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHow it went? There was off for three minutes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo, yeah, I got to figure out a small kink. It was working before. It's not working now, but that's just kind of how it goes. I would like to. I would like to do something with you all in the next five minutes and see how fast we can do it, which is kind of like get us into a next version. And what might that look like? That might look like we are building a fully automated outreach system which takes in profiles from LinkedIn and creates emails. Make a prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSorry, quick question. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIs it the name or the LinkedIn profile? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDon Solo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nJust Don Solo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWas that your question? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe input, is it just like the LinkedIn profile URL or. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCorrect the URL. Make a prompt for analyzing the data of LinkedIn profile and extracting only the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRelevant portions that would help create this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIs speedrun, the email, the outreach email. The context of what is relevant will be provided to the agent in a document. Make a prompt for an agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhich. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat's been your experience, Bartech, with like saying make a prompt for an agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI usually say make a prompt for AI that will do something like do X. And I say the X is what I want to do. Yeah, I didn't really test it, this version against making agents, but in before versions it was working just the same as actually it surprises in the way I would just say it. So it's like my childhood or something. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Well, it feels like it's gone to a point where it is reformulating. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo reformulating users requirements into a prompt for an AIA and then it's like the same format that, the standardized format. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat you're talking about. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. Constitutes relevant data for this purpose, ensuring the extraction process is both efficient and tailored to a specific needs of an automated outreach system. Innovative angle generator. Love it. Love it. AI expert, agent one, data analysis and extraction methodology expert. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMy God. Did it cut off early? It didn't create the markdown, did it? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nActually, that's correct. It should just guide you to like, you know, it's actually saying you to define your criteria. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nNot right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo it actually needs your input for the next step. If the next step can be without the user input, it should usually guide to the next sort of steps by saying you can't press the y letter on the keyboard and proceed to the next step. I think you could actually do that now and maybe AI will decide for you if you just press y and continue. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think I forget, include a fourth agent that will judge and that will criticize and provide feed forward on how to make the email more natural and human like. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou're referring to agents now in the brainstorming process or agents like you want to make four prompts? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI want to make four prompts, yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBecause now if you say include, it will include to the brainstorming here in the above. So I would start from before what you just written. I would just say in this agentic system include the fourth or in our plan? In our plan include fourth agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, cool, love it. And I'm going to go get the LinkedIn outreach prompt. I'm going to go get. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe story of fastrise. Where's the story of faster ICE? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI put it somewhere here. AI solutions. This is his profile. And then we're like, fast rise GPT. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhere are you? Where are you? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere we go. That's right, origin story. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I made a story and then I tagged prompt factory assistant to make it into instructions. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhat's been your experience with tagging and conversation length? Because I didn't quite use it that much and I'm curious about the constraints. How far can you go with making long conversation with one GPT and then mentioning another to answer to the whole conversation? I think you need to make a distinct now because it doesn't quite get it still that you're making swarm in here because it confuses the agents of its own in the brainstorming process and the agents you want to have in the swarm. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, well, let's find out. Oh, it revises the initial task to incorporate a fourth AI agent whose role is to critically review and provide constructive feedback on the generated emails. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSeasoned copy editor with a deep understanding of persuading. Engaging email communication doesn't just critique, it applies principles from psychology and marketing specific improvements that make emails more compelling. Yeah, it's definitely getting confused. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou can maybe say in our plan to make agent swarm for fully automated outreach system, like you can copy it from above how you started it all with the first sentence, fully automated outreach system. You can copy that and then say that the plan is to make the swarm that does this in the letter message. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInteresting. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nUnless this is actually what you want to build. If, if those description match what you wanted to achieve, then you can just say, make me prompt for each of those. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, so I would start with like, okay, great. Now write the full prompt for the AI expert, agent one, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes, the best of the parts here. And saying the prompt, take a great care to the details and expand it as much as you can and make the advanced markdown hierarchy, things like that. Also trying to make the stakes higher, like say something like this is very important or something. Or like those tricks giving tips to AI and stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI bet it works in here also, especially even though it has things like take time to think or do it step by step already in the prompt that I make for the PFA. But still, if you use it also in your prompts, it's even better, because it's like a kind of compound effect and it's not every time, get every word from the initial prompt. So it's better to always include something like take time to think about your own solution. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nDo every agent separately. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I'm going to ask it for now that it has all the context. And to answer your question, I am pretty sure that this is the 128,000 context window. Now write the full prompt for AI OLa for AI expert agent one, narrative. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTransformation. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd its emphasis on automating business processes to amplify human creativity, connection and strategic thinking. Develop a comprehensive data analysis and extraction methodology. Methodology should aim to identify and extract key information from diverse data sources that can be leveraged to automate business processes, enhance decision making and optimize marketing strategies. Alignment with fasterized core goals and services is something it has less information on. So this fasterized bio needs quite a bit of tuning, but yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo if. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe have this as an assistant API, it could know to grab this markdown and make it as the prompt of a new assistant. And I think that's like super exciting. That's great. Now continue with. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExpert two. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I'm going to grab this and I'm going to create a new agent and then we'll try the same thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWith can you send me this chat because I see another malfunction in here. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI'm going to drop out the call and just watch a video and follow it and do some more autogen stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSounds good. Sounds good. Yeah, sorry that I made it all about this. Yeah, sorry. Are there any questions about next steps? I want us to have a good v zero that you guys can play with to test it and stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nNo. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAll that comes to mind, I just message you, let me know. Is today your last day or are you online tomorrow? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm on a plane most of tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWhat time do you leave your home? I guess. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, 04:00 a.m.. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAll right, we'll catch up later today on just whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSounds good. Sounds good. Yeah, let's catch up later today. So what's cool is we can give this new GPT, this first GPT, the relevance action. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNot that give me 1 second in and. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, it was some point of equation. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYour. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSent you the thing, the linkman? Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI was thinking if you considered making your own scraper with the puppeteer and the GPT vision or maybe using some API, like there are those API kind of websites and you can buy some APIs. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI thought about it. It feels like the lift, the amount of work that we would be doing and research for a good one is more that we want to put into it. And the more that we want to put into it means that system, that API, whatever, usually stops working. We found a project on GitHub that would work, but it has a lot of limitations because your account gets easily banned. Yeah, your account gets easily banned on LinkedIn if you're scraping and stuff. So we didn't want that. Yeah, we really didn't want to risk that. And I realized that I gave it the documents instead of telling what to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDo with the future document. So I'm going to not do that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIf you want to humor me a few more minutes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWill. Okay, we'll restart that one. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhoa, it's writing in rust. That is funny. Oh, that's funny. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat's actually a title. That's actually correct behavior, because in the prompt it should go with two code windows. One should be title of the prompt. So for the user. But while doing the good behavior, it also fucked up the markdown. So you later have to make advanced markdown structure in the prompt because just how to say the bolt, it's only making it bolt and listing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo this is how it should run, right or no? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes, it should be there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAs you can see, when this is activated, this function, it's actually responsible partly for the structure, because all of the considering of the components is coming from first thinking of the structure. The relevance thing is working correctly. Just the prompt is wrong, right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe template was working just fine and then where you cloned it and it was working and then I must have changed something and it stopped working. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut it's not working in a prompt wise manner. Or is something wrong with the script or the automation? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt was scripting fine. Yeah, it was scraping fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo the prompt was wrong? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, it's supposed to parse the data into JSON and it wasn't doing it, but it was before, but then it suddenly stopped. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt don't think maybe there is better approach or maybe it's just something wrong with the copying, maybe that. Check it first, obviously. But I'm thinking you can also while doing something with those builders. If I have some troubleshooting to make, I usually make screenshots and send it to the chat. And now with the PFA brainstorming capabilities it's even better because it also can show you things you didn't think about. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo what you want to do next about this? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry, say that again. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNo, I'm just asking what you want to do next about this prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I'm going here I am changing this, and there's a couple things to change goals. Read and interpret the context document to understand company sex with Branson and the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nType of services we provide. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe provide nice LinkedIn profiles using. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, using. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYour analytical skills. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNow you could just make an iteration prompt for that. I'm just sending one command. Find it, maybe actually I'll even drop it in discord for everybody in the PFA. Also should share actually the new version for that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou said you dropped it in. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI'm just dropping it right now in the factory. Also the link. And I have a question for you. If you could encourage people to give feedback, like sending chats or whatever or screenshots of when they use it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, absolutely. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou're currently even turn that into some educational value. Maybe if we could gather this whole feedback somewhere on the discord, maybe. And then, I don't know, having some time to go over. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThey don't really have access to the latest version first, so maybe we could start there or whatever, a newer version so that you kind of get encouraged to use it in the first place. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFeel me? Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd we can go from there. But they saw it just now at work, so I think that can help with wanting to use it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's see. So were in templates and were searching LinkedIn. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, you got the command. We got distracted by the post. There is the command in the post to have the iteration this quoted command I sent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet'S see. This is the first agent, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThe user case. It's better actually to say something. Maybe it would figure it out, but always better to add what you want to do. Exactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIn user use cases. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIn personal life. User experiences and vacation rentals. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut I cannot ever write the word experience correctly. It's the nightmare of my english grammar. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nExperience experiencing said. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I have to check that in Google every time. Sometimes it's already so many times, sometimes I just don't give up. I noticed in a post I posted it wrong in here. And even to my juniors at celebrities, they also got it wrong. Chat deputy gets that. It doesn't have big worry about that. But still, I should correct that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSee, userless, a sophisticated keyword matching system. But then it's going to try to code and we don't want that. It already knows how to do this. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I would copy that frameworks or methods, copy this whole section, these two lines, and then say something like make those tangible thinking frameworks for AI. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou can add like just solely we're doing only prompt engineering. Something like that. We only focus on prompt engineering. What's your time and page in next hours? Because puffer wanted to make a meeting with four of us. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, it's not looking like there's time. We are rushing around already. I just really wanted to get this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOut. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor Henry and Kuba to be. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAble to keep going. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nBefore overdoing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTrue. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. Bartech, I'm still trudging along with this video stuff and I just wasted a bunch of time because now that I've taken all the silence out, I can't actually get the file out of the fire cut thingy. So what would be super helpful and probably good practice anyway. Can you turn on your camera, take a five minute video screen sharing of what is PFA? Because when the files are like five minutes or less, it's super easy to edit in canva. But with an hour and a half of content, I can't put it in canva. It's too big. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, we can do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, I think that'll be the fastest way and maybe it'll be expressed. So I'll fresh go at it. But yeah, I've just got to find what software. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWell, let's maybe think of some use case that would be. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBecause were thinking with Pavel. I mean maybe I'll call him because talk about this meeting. So if you guys have like ten minutes, we can briefly talk about this ICP because we are thinking about those middle aged corporate workers with some experience already under their debut. And maybe we can think from there. What's the best use case to show on those videos? To be aligned with what the corporate user would be doing with that PFA. All right, so you have like 15 minutes or something. So I call Pavel and he can join us here. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, right now I need to eat and talk with non. No, I don't have time. Later today at like 09:00 p.m.. GMT. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOr I just eat and listen and add some stuff. Okay. Yeah, let's just do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLet's do it right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, call Powell. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI just need like five minutes though. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo finishing this first agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI need to copy the story one more time. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe're going to give this action, which is going to be the relevance thing, which I'm going to finish up, figure out. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWe had to have a brief update because we actually wasn't talking today yet, Pablo. So yeah, he'll be joining a minute. You send him a link. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo that's the output of the PFA prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is, no, this is not the output of the TFA prompt. This is just getting the LinkedIn profile and we want to just return hey. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExperiences. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd we want to remove this LLM step right now. And it's just a tool output. You just want to say, hey, Jason. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI sent Pavel the link to this meeting or we make another page. Do you think. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLuci? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, let's do a different one. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd now if I say run all. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt should give me. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm not even using like credits. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nJust works as a tool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nName. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is what it returns. Experiences. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExperiences might be too long. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSome actions get LinkedIn profile open AI schema API key. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, so we're putting the meeting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, can you send me the link it Google me. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSure. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, cool. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-02-06 Dev Working Sesh - Scheduler Assistantcleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nRealizing what's important is the words you used. It feels a lot like realizing what's not important, realizing what's noise, realizing what's not critical. There's such clarity of what has to happen next that I had no doubt in my mind that would get there. And what does that look like? I'll get to the tangible in a second.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAs you know, we've been focusing very much on sales and we closed the client closed the first very small project with him and a lot of work, great work on the side of Bartek. So kudos to Bartek.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAfter the time of really having a lot of pressure, we hope that we'll manage to streamline those processes, at least in terms of syllabus. And that was the main focus. Let's go back to discussions about faster rides. I would like to push the competency metrics that we've been in talks with, and also I have developed kind of a roadmap for projects for Ops for 2024. Just wanted to create kind of a list of priorities, a list of projects that in the longer run should be covered in this space.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe will recheck on the competency matrix another time this week.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExcited to hear that you close the client, man. That's awesome. And that experience, working with a client more smoothly helps all of us understanding the process from hey, lead, it's getting better. And actually closing helps all of us. So I'm really excited for you guys.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI've been doing this chatbot basically for all this time, most of this time. Been able to make an upsell on one of the feedback calls. So that's what we are hoping for, to be closed as a bigger project, as Pablo mentioned.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI've been trying to find some time to work towards making a new version of PFA, but it's still just a concept. I have some plans to make it like kind of mentioned this GPT mentioned swarm, something like this. So have a few GPTs that can mention each other. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMulti agents communicating with each other is going to transfer context. That actually makes it useful and not generic. And the more technical part, the wood vector databases we're using for the knowledge base. Alvi had some great comments today on how do you make the information flow more useful? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere is so much on these knowledge base conversations that we've had over the last few weeks, so much on the applications of hey, now we have all these companies' information and it's in a vector database and we're going to do useful things, retrieving it.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe'll start doing YouTube shorts. How does this play into our plan? And I will map this out because it's all in my head and I don't want to lead you guys through some abstract image of what I'm picturing, but damn, the image is so clear in my head. Let's get to work. Let's get to something finalized. Let's get to something we can show. That's a step number one.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm going to do a lot of work this week on getting this automated transcript maker that feeds the knowledge base up and running so we can actually put it out on YouTube so we can like, hey, here's a 1 minute short, and here's another 1 minute short.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe should focus on this so we can have a thing that we're doing that has a purpose, a very clear purpose. And the outcome is very clear, you guys, is the sale.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm developing, bringing in and developing and changing, updating a lot of different frameworks that the overarching theme for those frameworks is. The one theme is how to like whenever there's going to be a client, that the main pain point is around adoption of AI. How do you do these training or workshops to learn people how to use AI within their workflows, how to identify this stuff.Speaker 2\\nThis is also the thing that I've been working on very much for last couple of days, last couple of weeks as I've been finishing this kind of extract course that I've done. It's called mini MB, a for AI for business. So I've closed this project last week also, and I'm gathering all this knowledge to change a little bit, develop myself, put my stuff that I also have from my past experience and develop these kind of a frameworks. So this is one of a kind of a syllabus kind of a know how and knowledge that we would be able to fit into this knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd another stuff is mostly connected with my previous background experience that I've been working for many years for a strategic consulting boutique here in Poland that was very closely associated with MBA program on Waso University. So this is another space, this is very much connected to kind of basically the frameworks and the knowledge that you learn on business studies worldwide. And I'm also working in the background on this kind of frameworks for how to, whenever there's going to be a client that would like to learn how to push the differentiation that the company has. As we've had this conversation, probably you remember that there's going to be a future when each company's employee going to use this personal AI assistance in the situation where each company, they work for us, they're going to work on the basis of the same AI. Where's the differentiation? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo this assistance needs to be covering, conveying, pushing the unique know how knowledge that this company has built for the years along, for many years, right? So this knowledge, this know how is in their Sops, in their procedures, in their joint experience and know how of their employees and all this space going to be sometime there's going to be a need to learn the underlying AI, the underlying knowledge bases for each of the corporations, each of the company separately, so they remain the competitive advantage. So this is the thing that we call it with Bartech, we call it strategic alignment of the underlying AI, of the underlying knowledge base. That's a huge thing. And I'm working on that as a kind of a second focus for celebrities. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd there is a discussion that is still quite niche, but in the space of AI, I see that more and more professionals are starting to discuss about it. So there's going to be probably a growing trend and discussion about how to differentiate my AI and yours AI to remain and keep this strategic differentiation for our company. Yeah, so those are the two spaces that I'm very much interested in. The second one is a little bit more future focused and a little bit like not very much. It's still in development, so it's not ready to use the knowledge base that you are building in. But in terms of the first one that I have some training, some documents, some stuff to fit in the knowledge base, I would be very happy to experiment with that. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSomething that comes to mind for me in terms of what we need to look out for is I don't want to provide a solution to a client and then one month later OpenAI release the same feature and they go, oh, I got scammed, or something like that. So being aware of what's coming out, for example, something that's similar to the knowledge base retrieval thing that we're doing is Microsoft's copilot. So I'll look into that and see how I think it differs slightly. Like you can ask, oh, questions about the meeting and it can answer them, but it won't be as rag oriented or stuff like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNot yet. That's part of what Avi was talking about that Microsoft is already starting to implement. Hey, here's everything we know about your company and here's how to make it useful. And it brings up an interesting point, which is we think we're early to the party. How late are we actually? Let's say we are late, we find a client and we start working with them. They pay what costs, which is not cheap. And then what happens? Microsoft comes out with a similar product. What do we have? Well, we have, number one, the relationship with them, showing them that we can build something of quality. And then it just upsells because we know them. Microsoft doesn't know them. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMicrosoft has information about them that they can do in something useful, of course, but the relationship and the context is so much more powerful to create a long term business relationship of doing useful things for them, things of value, than like, oh, we have better technology, so we understand your information better. That's why that first client is so vital, because it leads towards, oh, these guys know how to work. These guys understand this thing, oh, these guys are building something similar to what Microsoft is building. Oh, interesting. Yeah, exactly. So late to the party. Early to the party. The reality is we're early because most CEOs, most companies are not ready to implement this. And that's the key here, that they're not ready. So we have time. We have time. I know you're going to bounce, Bartech. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGood luck with your next meeting and we will most certainly connect. Yep. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSee ya, guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSee ya. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat was a perfect answer, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm telling you, man, it's so fucking clear in my head. Yeah, I have not a single doubt in my head. And I don't want that to mean, okay, let me put it this way. If that starts coming through as me having all the answers, please pause me, please stop me, because I don't have all the answers. I just have clarity of a to 1 second. 1 second, definitely. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt reminds me actually of another company that they're called class stars. I don't know if I've talked to you about class stars, Alejo, a little bit before. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I remember. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou remember class stars. The issue is that they are imposing their system. Imposing might be a strong word on teachers as opposed to providing the technological structure for a school to align their principles and their methodology within the technology. So in Bermuda, this coaching program, which I think could be licensed by the International Federation of Life Coaches, they just don't have the official cert, probably haven't paid for it. They have a very unique system that they use. Right. Another coaching program or mentorship program might have another system that they use. So a sort of skeleton that could match or align with each different sort of methodology for an organization is what I'm mulling over in my mind. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, totally. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd also I guess on a related but similar, related but tangential note, I am feeling a bit like I have my feet in too many lanes and I want to figure out what the lane is with faster eyes, where I can be most effective and have most of my strengths in which on the business development side is education, is having these conversations with educators and figuring out what some of the biggest challenges are. And I don't have the bandwidth to do that and outreach and make social media posts and market. Then it just kind of feels like I'm kind of hitting deliverables in all of those areas but not really thriving in one. That's sort of where I'm at. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I get that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMakes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think we've all kind of felt that way at one point or another in the last few months. A lot of everything. And I want to be able to do the thing that is most effective for the organization. That also doesn't drain as much because I enjoy so much. Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThere's an acceptance of this. Of what bandwidth do we realistically have with the people who are at the table right now and what is the priority? It's important that we have a presence. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I think what I'll do is I think building in public is the simplest way to hosting and working at the same time. So, for example, when we had a dev meeting, I spoke about how I was learning these courses online on stuff. So I'll just do videos on those courses and then just share them with you guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, we can do. Asked him. I asked Henry. Hey, you're doing this course. Teach it to us. Come share what you learned. And now we're going to have it recorded because we record everything and we can put it into shorts. That could be a five short series, even like DL knowledge bases for applications. Core lesson one. One out of five. And we have one week of content there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, and maybe that's the shift is let's just post videos about what we're doing. Let's teach people, let's give the free value. We've been talking about as far as educating people about AI, about tools, about how they can use it, about what we're learning, and that's content. We don't need to write long LinkedIn posts about whatever that chat GBT mostly wrote anyways. It doesn't really resonate with people. They want the human. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. Something I was thinking about today was because I was thinking about, okay, how could lewis like, get better? And I was thinking about, okay, when I'm working, what do people like the most? And it's like people, either they come into the store for two things. It's either they know what they want to buy and they're just here to grab it and go, or they want to talk to someone and learn something and then decide if they want to buy or not, but they first want to learn and then decide. And the amount of people that, for example, every time I've gone, okay, let me explain to you how the computer works. This is the Ram, this is the CPU, this is how they work together. Then almost every time they buy, instead of. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIf I was just going to be like, oh, this is the computer you need. It's not always the best tactic, but along the same sort of trajectory. When I've had it, for example, that economist, when I just showed him chat GPT and it was the most simplest thing and he was allowed to just see it, he had the best reaction and was open to so much. So, for example, just posting, oh, this is chat GPT, could get so much engagement just alone. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think what's really cool about coming from the environment that we just came from and the methodology that we've been getting training on, that I've been training on for the past eight years now around how to guide learning experiences is unique from how most YouTubers are teaching things. And I think that could set us apart. Like Liam's got how many videos on how to use Chatcheet BT some of them are very highly technical. But what if we show not tell, right? What if we make it? I mean, I feel like I need to show not tell right now because it's like the facilitation style of teaching and learning that has a lot of potential to be extremely engaging and then speak to people where they are in their world. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSomething that we talk about with kids is when we're connecting content to examples, it's, well, how do we bring their world into our world? What are they into? What music are they listening to? What TV shows? What video games? What is their day to day reality or an experience that they have that I can draw from. Oh, you know that feeling when you stay up late, you start playing a video game and then 4 hours go by and you realize it's midnight and you've been playing for 4 hours and you're like, I was supposed to do my homework. Everyone's like, kids have been there. Or when you know you're supposed to be doing your chores and your parents are nagging at you and you just get the annoying feeling. So finding those ways to incorporate that into video learning, right, it's a little. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBit different into everything, into cold calling, into email outreach, into how we do the videos, how do we bring their world to ours and then our world to theirs? It's such an applicable concept. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI mean, education will change completely with the use of AI. You can bring such a higher level of education to underprivileged kids. You don't have to fly out the best PhD lecturer, you can just upload a chat GPT guy. So yeah, I'm really looking forward to being part of the transition towards AI and education and seeing how that all falls together. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh yeah, it's very exciting and I think we're very well positioned for that. In interest in experience, from pages wild amount of experience in the field and having seen so many layers of it, from what is being a teacher to what is being a parent who has a child who is getting educated, to being the child who is getting educated and what is working and what isn't, and the system that her organization has developed, the level of comprehension of what goes in the brains and how the outside stimuli gets processed. What actually is learning is incredible, just so you get a glimpse of what the hell we're talking about. You said what worked with the economist was you explained to him with words, you showed it to him and then he was able to play with it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo he engaged the three channels that we have to process information. The auditory, because heard your words, the visual, because you showed it. And the most important one, man, the kinesthetic, where he could actually have it in his hands and feel it, do it, do the thing, because if we hear it and see it, we'll have an image of it, we'll be able to remember it. But what's the impact? Where's the aha moment in looking at it, in listening about it? It's doing it that brings the aha moment. So in cold calling, how can we integrate the three when we only get audio? How can we help them create a picture? Sure. Understand their pain points and stuff, but create a picture of the outcome. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCreate a picture for them in their minds of, oh, this is what it would look like to have all these things running smoothly or to not have this problem anymore. This is what it would feel like to be able to not have to hit HR about this one policy and how this would apply to whatever these clients or these communications or whatever. Oh, I can just ask the question to the system that we have. So this is all very still, very abstract because we've yet to solidify the vision of what the product is. The question here is what has worked and why is it that it works? When we engage the three channels, the listening to it, the looking at it, which a video does, and then the third one, which is call to action, actually doing it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHey, and in the description is the Jupyter notebook, is the Google Colab. Just click on and just run all the cells. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAs you say that. One of the reasons I like deep learning AI is you go on the thing and you've got the video there and you've got the notebook there and you're doing it at the same time. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, exactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo the foundations of what resonates with people, for example, engaging the three channels of information is where we have to start from for anything that we do and have fun with it. How would that look like for emails? Because we talk about a lot about, like, we talk a lot in emails, but how can we help them create pictures about what we do without mentioning AI, without mentioning chat bots? And how can we help them create a feeling of what it would be like to have what we sell the challenge. Without mentioning AI, without mentioning chat bots? Talk about impact, talk about remembering, talk about feeling. Oh, yeah, I do want to reply to this person. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWell, then our testimonials will be great to show this is how X felt when they had it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou're already catching on. Yeah. Where do we start prioritizing, reprioritizing and removing the fluff. Again, if it was just the three of us, how much would we had to eliminate from all of our plates? Writing blogs on LinkedIn is out. Long form content is out. We don't have the bandwidth for that. But it's not just the three of us. We have Kuba, we have Avi to some capacity. We have Powell and we have Bartech to some capacity. Okay, great. And that's how we can have the level ups, what they see, what they can do, that us three can't do. But let's still minimize and focus on what's effective and what leads us to our outcome. First client. And we're going to have to be patient. We're going to have to be patient because we could be cold calling all day. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd what do we sell when we're cold calling? We have less clarity on that. So development needs a focus. Content needs a focus. Marketing needs a focus. Let's make sure we're doing the effective activities. Money making activities. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, there's something that reminds me of the 80 20 rule. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI agree. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAlso one of the Singapore partner, our new Singapore partner, he went out and started his own company, basically helping people build their brands and make money. And he walked us through this very quickly. High level overview of the methodology that he used. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm looking it up. It includes virtual event. Live event is the last part. And the first one is. The first one are. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBrand like your brand. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt had a very simple logic to it so we can figure it out. It's videos online which help define the brand. So content online, that was brand. Then there's a second one, then it's virtual event. Like a live virtual conference for example, or a workshop that's live and out there. Community, brand, community, virtual event, live event. Let's scratch live event for now. But that process creates such a simple framework. We have brand, so the content that we have some way to engage with them through some sort of community. And then a virtual event and it all builds up on each other. And that's what works nowadays. That sure worked ten years ago, but there's a lot of things that worked ten years ago that don't work now. Like having a website and expecting people to pay for your thing nowadays. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut it used to ten years ago. So the level of sophistication is higher and the level of variety that creates credibility is higher. It used to be just having a nice website. It's credibility enough nowadays, no? So step one, content. Step one, shorts. We have stuff to do off of shorts for. We have hell of stuff to do shorts for. Think about each product that we have. We have our story. You just mentioned what you learned, which if we can talk about it for, if you can chunk it into five important things of 40 seconds each, that's a week worth of content, dude, that we can bang out in an hour. It doesn't need to be perfect. We just have to have a bit of a script. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou know what would be interesting? Do you remember that tool I said, the one that's designed for podcasts and it clips up all podcasts. You could throw in some of the recordings of this and just out the clips that it froze out. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think that's a great idea. What was it called? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI want to say Miro, but it's not Miro. Miro is something else. Opus pro opus. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. The only thing I'm thinking about is let's make sure that we create. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nA. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nStory so there's a lot that we can take out of all the recordings that we have. And if we're talking about quality, it means preparation. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. What I do if we're talking story is we need to set it up so that we explain everything and where we're at up until now. And then we do weekly or biweekly updates. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou mean for building in public specifically. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOr just in general building the company in public? Not just building certain projects, building the whole company in public. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. So now we're talking about getting together, the three of us, and just talking about faster eyes. How has everything happened? What Aha moments have we had over the last five months? Four months. And that's number one, going to help us with the master system prompt about who we are and also get content for shorts about what we're about. So for shorts we have kind of like faster story, deep learning AI course we have projects till now which we can just show as demos. We can do a demo for each of the projects. And when I say that the stuff that we learned and the stuff that we'll be going through goes really deep, we're talking about different frameworks that we have that very simple allow you to have define your objective. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd then what is each thing, each segment, each sentence that happens before that gets you closer to that objective. For example, through this demo, the objective of this content of this 1 minute video is for the person watching it to briefly understand what we're about, see the quality of what we can build, and understand the vision of what we'll be able to build. So who we are, what we built, and the vision of what we can build. The challenge is in less than 1 minute. So that's what we're talking about. Gamifying. Gamify the fuck out of that. You have 30 seconds. Telling the fasterized story too much. You don't leave time for the demo. Bring it down to ten. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAlso, how much the thing is with the company story, I'm not sure how much we want to say, because what if it's because I like being able to. For example, you can hide behind the fact that all your developers didn't come from some random discord channel. And that you can pretend that they are actual developers or, I don't know, there's pros and cons to putting everything not public, I guess. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nVery good question. Very good observation. What I'm talking about is let's just talk within ourselves. Let's figure out what the story has been so far and then we'll figure out what we put out there. I think we all need clarity on like. Yeah, this has been the story so far to then align on what comes next. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. So let's schedule that for this week and we can sit down for an hour and talk within each of not. We have not. Henry, what did you ask? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI said we'll just have a timeline and we'll just go for it step by step and see if we can. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's exactly right. We can have a timeline and then for fast rise story, we're talking about scheduling the time. Schedule time and create a timeline that'll help us structure it better. Good idea. We'll connect. We'll take this week to connect with everyone at faster ICE and also take some time in the coming week to clean up the discord. Because if it is six or seven of us, I want that to be very clear that it's six or seven of us and we'll know how much to simplify. So. So. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I'm. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI'm ready to get going. I think my next step would be just writing out what I'm doing and what focus blocks and then I'll just work, get it done. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI've got to do that too. And going to really just connect, reconnecting with people, especially the folks that have been on marketing, that nobody has the same consistent hours that we can meet. So it's been a lot of async. Anyways, we're going to start there. Also going to get some focus blocks and clear objectives of where we're going next. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we will extra dig into ownership, we will extra dig into you own this now and this fails or succeeds on your shoulders, you're not in that day, it's still your responsibility. So find somebody who can do that thing, do that post that day, do whatever needs to happen to reach the right. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. I'm really happy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nReally good to be back. Good to see you again, Henry. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGood to see you, Henry. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nGood to see you both. I missed you. Got quite bored at some point? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Bad. Well, you'll be quite entertained this coming week. So what are the things you're doing? We're working on the next couple of days in the next 48 hours. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes. So main next 48 hours probably learn, finish learning what I want to teach and then writing out a plan to teach it. And then I've also got to look into instantly API. So I've got three things. So learn deep learning API, learn the course, teach the course, look into the instantly be. It might be easier. I just make like five YouTube videos and then we plug those into a tool and get clips out of them. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'll help you on that. You know what's even easier? Let's have a conversation. We'll ask you questions. You tell us, we ask you questions. And then from there the nuggets come out. We don't want to make you have to think of every valuable thing in the course. Let's get curious together and then find the gold nuggets from there. Because we only get 1 minute. Sure, five videos, but 1 minute each. It's the in depth part that is most valuable. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI see. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo honestly, I envision it as we build these videos that we will post. We do them together, we interact with each other. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo instead of having to do three, four different times, we can do it together once. And then we bring it, and then. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe get good enough and turn it into a podcast. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Bam. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThen you guys already have a podcast. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe have one episode of podcast. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe have one episode. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGot to get more episodes of a podcast. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we step into education. There are so many critical conversations of what works, what doesn't, what is just and what is unjust in the world of education. What is changing, how are things shifting? Because again, what we noticed the trainers, and we're talking decades of training that pages partners have decades of specialized training and coaching and facilitating. And they were like, we have to change the map right now because they were doing the event and these kids are not resonating with what usually works. That's something super interesting to talk about. Call it post COVID reasons, call it screens. And that's why, well, there are different branches. So we have so much to talk about in terms of podcasts that could call the attention of people that are in the field. It's like, oh, these guys can see the vision of what's changing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd they also work in AI to adapt the world to this new changing changes in education. Those are the people I want to work with. So let's make sure that the content that we're putting out leads into this is what we're working on, which is the part of credibility and making it very relatable, simplified, relatable and it'll stick. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt'll stick. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you, Paige, for being here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThank you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you, Henry. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThank you all for being here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's. Let's keep going. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet's keep going. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI'll speak tomorrow. I'll see you guys tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSee you tomorrow, brother. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBye, Henry. Bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-02-19 Advocates Meeting, reconnect after camp and plan, simplify and move forwardcleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 3\\nWe never really talked after I took the full time position. Much doing company I was working for before needs some help, and so looks like I'm going to be pretty involved. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIn that for a while. Cool. That's awesome. To the same capacity as to. As of right now or more than full time? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe contract is full time, but spending way more time. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNot much. Apart from this week's been slow. I had to put my dog down, so that wasn't actually that great.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then I've just been reading, learning, working, I guess. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. What you been reading about? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMindset by dweck. So growth and fixed mindset. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's awesome. Yeah, Paige and I did a lot of mindset work, certainly. Well, this camp, we had two trainers who are just top of the line facilitation coaches. And it was transformational for sure. The camp itself was for teenagers in Bermuda, and it's around personal development and social and emotional development. And a lot of these kids come from very rough backgrounds. So it was very interesting from creating a rapport with people in very different backgrounds that any of us grew up in to helping them sort of find the key points or key experiences in their lives that have made them who they are. And at 1314, what to do from that point on as they start developing self awareness. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd they start getting into more risky situations in difficult backgrounds and kind of this empowerment to look at the choice in front of you and make the, let's say, more useful choice for your. It was. It's a fascinating thing that pages organization works in. So honored to have been there and getting like one one coaching with these amazing trainers. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI have my V one ready of the agents. So that's what I've been doing online chain. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Are you able to show us right now? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, can you see my. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo did you mention you're ready to show us the demo you have so far? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo. So this is my library. I'm using Google collab because I'll load the libraries in slow form. I'm just losing libraries. Just give me a minute. So I'm going to import all the libraries, the Google sub for creating it. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe OpenAI chat module, the agent executor, the prompt templates, and also import all of that. Taking a while because my network is slow. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, no worries. Take your time. You can start walking us through the code while everything installs. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAll right, so these are my API keys to check the log of my agents and to check token usage. So my API keys. So like a class I created for extracting the top three searches from Google self API. So what actually does. Okay, this is my tool I created for agents. Let me go to my prompt so you can actually understand. Okay, so this is the prompt template I created. So I'm telling the that I want you to get the URL link to the person's LinkedIn profile page. The answer should only contain a unique profile. So this I created is what contains the search result from my Google set API. Do you understand? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. Following. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo this is just like chain of thoughts. This is the import and this is the agent scratch bob. So I created like a prompt template here. I created my tools, I chose my llm, I created my tools, I kept the prompt. So this is the agent. I'll just, I just need to type the person's name. Like this is Demi Asabi, the CEO of DeepMind rather. So it's going to search Google and return only the URL of the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGreat. Awesome, awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo for the LinkedIn script, I use proxy code that I told you about. So I defined a function that uses the LinkedIn. The result I got as like the URL I got. So I used it to extract details about demi Asabi using the proxy call API. So this is the result. It returns details about demi Asabi. I created another prompt to extract the details and format it. The full name of the person. A little bit of introduction project that the person involved on the experience. The topic of interest of the person based on the data I'm getting from proxy code. This is the output here. I'm using LLM chain for that. So this is the result here. I created another tool before the two year. So I imported the knowledge bees or pastries. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I'm trying to create a lead qualifier based on the information I got from proxy call. I want to do qualify the lead if it's ran with our something like that. If based on the data I got from proxy call, the person aligns with fast price. So I imported our knowledge. I split it into chunks. I split it into chunks. I created it too for the analyzer. I created the agents for it. So this is it. This is the results. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. I like the icebreakers idea. That's a great idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nJimmy Asabi is the perfect match for our company based on his profile information analyzed with our strategic intelligence. Based on this, I created another agent to write the email using our knowledge bees like information about our knowledge bees and based on information we got about the Miyasabi. So this is the prompt for writing the emails. This is the result. I'm reaching out to introduce you to our company pastries, which is at the forefront of innovation in artificial intelligence, giving an impressive background in artificial intelligence, machine learning and communication science. Your role, I believe there is. So it goes on like that. Our team at focusing on automation, data analysis, and market optimization. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd is this the writer agent that's writing this or is this after an evaluator? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe writer agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt writes the email and I got the output. Then this is the evaluator. Then I created the prompt asking it to review the email. This is just so this is the input. This is the email generated. So the email is well written and personalized, addressing the recipient background and expertise in a toxic manner. However, there are some areas that can be improved to clarity, engagement and relatability. Identify areas for improvements. The introduction could be more concise. Immediately captures the recipient attention just talking about the. So it's giving us suggestions. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. This is great. This is great. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's what I've been up to. That's all for now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHey, that's fantastic. Great job. Great job. What are your, what are the next steps in your opinion? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. Thinking of recreating or using long graph because landgraph is more flexible. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFlexible in what way? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYour concept, like now, you can create nodes and edges. The agents can think of the next agent that is meant to under the tax based on the user input. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSomething. It's more flexible to build agents, but I've not really dived deep. I'm just like laying because it's a very new concept. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, for sure. Well, great job. There are some really good gold nuggets in there. Like the icebreakers. Feel very natural. Simple enough, but very natural. The tips of the critic feel very on point, feel very relevant. To make that email better, expressing conciseness, besting relatability, we have to make sure that the writer, agent and the critic can talk to one another back and forth. That might be a next version kind of situation where a writer, critic, writer, critic, writer. Just like a couple of loops might be more than good enough for now, if not just one loop before we start adding layers on and actually doing a campaign for ourselves. So actually sending these out to whom there's a strategic, we're going to be talking with advocates today. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd part of this clarity that we gained over this past week is target market for some of these tools, some of what you just showed where right now in reality we're just using it for ourselves? So what if we can leverage not only this tool for ourselves, for massive email campaigns, but also start making content out of it which will essentially by itself help us create reputation credibility building in public? So we'll get to that point. So let's focus on the very much right now, how do we make this massively runnable, meaning not on Google Colab? And would this be running the same program in parallel through a list of names, for example, that finds their Linkedins? Or maybe they can input their Linkedins and we just have this program running a lot in parallel?Speaker 4\\nI was trying to get an API. If I could get an API, I could make it work. I asked him about it and said, you're not around so I could not use the profile analyzer IPA. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, which we're talking is as simple as could be as simple as transferring this to an assistant API and have that running by itself as opposed to GPT and we can start interacting agents with each other. That is what you mean, right? Kuba having the agent available through an API? Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, that's what I mean. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, then make relevance actions into tools for assistant API. Great. Okay, want to pause that for now? And we'll focus on these three items, which is figuring out how to run it in parallel. Actually, once we figure out how to run this in parallel, how do we verify that we have the right LinkedIn account and make relevance actions into tools for assistant API? Defining the right LinkedIn account brings the question of like, well, how do we even find these leads in the first place? How do we get these names? And if they come from different lead lists, then we would have some other resource like their email or maybe even directly their LinkedIn. I don't see that as a main blocker. We can find the right LinkedIn account with very little problem. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe LinkedIn account is a very good one because I tried searching for some otoman but it was returning different searches of some Otoman LinkedIn accounts. It was not like the real Sam Otman. So I think the problem. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. What else is something that during this week we'll need to solve. In order to have this one step closer to productionized. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe'Ll need it linked to an email sender, because we don't want to copy and paste everything. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, we do not. So we have access to the instantly API, which would satisfy that, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, wonderful. We'll get that linked. We'll revise prompts. Great job on the prompts, who are simple enough, straightforward, easily explainable. Let's make sure that they're at production grade and leverage what we have, which is prompt factory, which I think I noticed you might have used in one of the prompts. And it looks really good. So we'll do revision of prompts, which include PFA, adding examples of good to better. This is a good email, but this is an even better email. Give it some examples. The faster ICE bio, which is going to be part of essentially the majority of the context. Okay. So that is quite a few things. We have the massive personalized outreach. Okay, and this last point links to the other project we've been talking about, the knowledge base builder. And, man, I'm excited about this one. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere's a lot that I want to say. Let me just concise it. Pages of the organization has been building a knowledge base for several months, and they didn't even know that they were building a knowledge base. They are surprisingly well set up to have a system that will intake all of this information, which goes from, how do you create a day program for a summer camp? Let's say, imagine a leadership program, a leadership summer camp. How do you create the schedule for the day? From that to how do you create a speech for each key talk? What do you do when you have all these videos of people actually doing the keynote talks? All theory, which also comes, which is very interesting, because they have theory, which they won't follow on purpose, but that is a good foundation. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is theory, and this is how it looks like and feels like and sounds like in the real world when a professional actually does it. This is the framework that they use. All of this is in this big spreadsheet that line by line depends into, honestly, all the details. Hey, we're talking about balance, which is actually the keynote talk. I did. And I did actually a technology space, a technology open space, which was student lest led discussions on the pros and cons of technology. And there's a theory of how to go about that talk, and then there's how we did in practice. And in that it includes, hey, these are different experiences that the kids can actually go through in a kinesthetic way, that they can feel the experience. These are the outcomes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is the outcome of this experience is for the kids to gain awareness of the choices that they have with technology. And if you have to start from scratch for any of this keynote talks, you're wasting 2 hours at least figuring out where to start and creating an initial draft. But you have all the. They have the knowledge base, and the owner's eyes literally widened when they realized, oh, wait, we can create a good draft and then make it masterful and save ourselves so much time and so much cognitive work. Because they are the masters, they know how to make it masterful, but they don't really need to spend as much time doing an initial draft. So, guys, it seems like we have our first pilot, free but man leverageable. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd the testimonial for this, the branches that we can go through this is substantial. It might be our intro into the education industry, or simply, hey, this is what our technology can look like. This is how a first representation of this is how we can put our vision of how companies can work better into reality. And here's their testimonial. So let's review that system real quick, and there are shifts to make. And Avi, I am so glad you're here, because we've been having all these conversations over the last few weeks, and there is a lot to figure out. There's a lot to figure out in a very exciting way. Very exciting way. Let's see if Zoom lets me. There we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo, I don't know that I've walked you through this one, Abi, and it's been a couple of weeks since I looked at this. Let me keep it simple. Right now, we have a system which will take the transcripts, will take the audios of our meetings, create transcripts with timestamps, create a semantic cleaner, remove everything about the transcript that doesn't serve any purpose, like us catching up, step into a kind of opposite, critical conversation analysis, and then create a contextual executive summary. So what does this executive summary look like? Well, we have our purpose for our meetings. And within each department, a general meeting has a different purpose than dev meeting. So that contextual, that's where that comes in. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is one system, one subsystem that we almost have up and running that I will fight my hardest to have up and running this week. But there's some two tangents to this, which is the pre context, the company story, who we are as staff, strides all the people that we have and what each person does, each person specializes in. The clients are our ideal customer profiles, clients that we're working with, clients that we're hoping to work with. How does that context feed into what is a relevant contextual summary? That's obviously a redundant question. So with the context of our company and the information from our calls, how can we make useful things out of that? Obviously, having everything vector database, and maybe even in a traditional database, we can step into those details later. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe can have, say, a massive outreach system that we can rely on because we know it reads our brand, it understands our brand, it understands what we're looking for. Our ideal customer profiles, maybe it uses a Persona, let's say Alex Promosi frameworks that it can leverage. So these essentially three systems, one, two, you can't really call this a system, but anyway, the components, and three, the actual application is what I envision will be our core product. From there, different things come. But what if we can have this for clients that we work with as a base? And then, oh, hey, I need a massive outreach system. Okay, great. We already have everything that you do, the products that you've done, the context of your company, the history, the people that you have in there, and your ideal customer profile. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is just one step as opposed to, hey guys, we have to design a whole massive outreach system like we did the first time. We started thinking about this massive outreach system from scratch. What if it was the other way around and we can just think about it for ourselves, not about a hypothetical customer that we'll have just for ourselves. Once we have this, what else becomes possible? So that's what we're going to keep developing. And I'm going to stop sharing screen. And when you mentioned about, well, one of the steps for this massive outreach system, revising the prompts is very much tied to the rest of the project. Having a fasterized bio, having examples of good and better. What are the next steps for this knowledge base builder? We're going to pause on that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd once I have a bit more clarity on where we're at, where it's needed to have this up and running, we'll production exit because I could tell you a few things that are going to work on it, but I don't want to lose you guys in lack of context. So I'm going to put out something visual and we'll go from there. For now, I think we have our hands busy with the outreach system and actually getting to test it and such. But as I'm saying that I realized Puba is putting a lot of time into this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo I'm curious, Henry, Avi, if we're to keep it simple, if we're to keep it focused, which of these two projects, which could be the massive outreach system or stepping into the knowledge base builder, which, although there's code and very powerful code, and a lot of these components are already written, it's a bit of a more abstract thing that we're working on. We're not exactly sure what the final product looks like yet. Which one calls your attention more to work on more of the creative design? Let's put it together and then start writing the code or the. We know what it is, it's email writer and we've created the sophisticated system, et cetera. What's your attention? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm happy to do a bit on both, to be honest, because also whilst you're away, I did those deep learning AI courses on pine cone and rag searches, semantic cleaning, and that's what stuff I can take a look at, find really interesting. So probably that one calls to me more the knowledge base, but I've also been involved in the personalized outreach for a bit, so I do want to see. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. You mentioned you started the course or you finished the course. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think I've got like two modules left, but I can get them done today. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, I guess returning your advice to all of us too, let's do the Feynman method and teach it to us this week. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEven just a one pager. What you learned is going to be very critical. I'll share something after this meeting that I think we all need to be on our toes about, which is along the lines of fine tuning, model fine tuning, LLMs. We were thinking about a paid client. I doubt that they'll go with a vanilla version of GPP four, even if with personalized prompt. But that's something else. I'm getting way ahead of myself. I'm going to share a cool resource I learned, period. If you can summarize what you learned and walk us through some of that, maybe with code, even maybe conceptual. Yeah, that'd be awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'll do it on notebook. Supersonic notebook and just cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, great idea. What about you, Avi? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, so, terms of time to contribute, I don't have a lot, but if you need any help with trying to plan out any of this effort, or trying to figure out what components need to put in, how do they interact with each other, things like that. Happy to help out. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou're reading my mind, which is what? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI guess the purpose for joining this call was to just let you guys know that I don't have time for active development. Cool. And I think we discussed this right at the start. I didn't know how long I would have for being able to contribute a lot. And so yeah, I'm happy to help in whatever way I can. Like for the knowledge base builder, I think, I don't know just what Kuba was talking about, but he mentioned something about using graphs where you have nodes and relationships. I think that's a good thing to explore. I think Microsoft is doing something along those lines with all of their information they collect on clients. So they build for each of their companies using all of their products, which is like Windows OS, their docs, their cloud storage, their email, their slack messages. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThey have the platform for all of them. And a lot of companies that are not too technical. I've not experienced that in software development companies, but business companies, a lot of them use Microsoft products for their entire stack. So those companies, it's a good sale to make for Microsoft where you already have all your information. With us we can for this additional paid service organize all of your information, answer questions that are relevant to your business in a smart way because we know everything about the business already. Yeah, so they mentioned in one of their talks having like a knowledge graph for all of the information they have on their system. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhich is another reason to explore that route. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUse vector data to explore the Microsoft route. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou mean just using graphs to figure out how do you want to structure your knowledge? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's right. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat do you want to store? What relationships do you want between knowledge based stores? How do they interact with each other? Like when do you access one particular type of knowledge base? You don't want to just put everything in one vector data store, just dump everything in there and expect things to work. Well, I don't think that will, at least in the current state. It's just too much information I don't think will lead to anything valuable. What you need to think about is what is the information you're trying to store in each knowledge base? Like what is important, when do you access it? And then you create a relationship around that. So when you need this sort of information, this is where you go look for it versus if you needed something about information about your internal employee profile, then you go look here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIf you want something about your business customer, like target clients or what your business does, there's this other store you look at. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's ease. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSeparating those makes it easier to keep them clean and make sure the information there is useful is valuable. And you can have mechanisms to add to it that are gated by humans where you don't necessarily change, like have any random meeting or anything like that, adding to what your business does if it's not appropriate. But you can if it's appropriate. That's why you have the gate. So it might be like, oh, from this particular meeting you decided a pivot where your company is going to start shifting focus. And that comes out as like a gated request. You update your company's like what it does sort of knowledge base and things like that. And sometimes vector based database may not be the right answer. Just look for the appropriate source. For you'll want embeddings, but not necessarily just take chunk of text, put it in. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou'll need a lot more metadata. I don't know if Davis. I think Ahmed and JFK may have been working on other sources of retrieval which are not just like semantic search, but using metadata or having additional metadata stored along with embeddings. If you've not done that already, definitely worth looking into it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. So right now the length of the metadata is what type of meeting is it? Dev general marketing outreach. I really like what you're bringing up. It makes a lot of sense and it totally hits again. I could talk 1 hour, 5 hours about the vision that is becoming clearer for these sets of products. This essentially suite of products rooted in a knowledge base. How do we make it so the sales manager and the CEO ask the exact same question and get a wildly different response. The information that gets accessed is different and you just gave the key of how you do it, what you create dates of what is considered relevant. Yeah, go ahead. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nFor this question, you phrase specifically. It sounded to me like they wanted the same information. But how does presentation differ? And that could be the retrieval part of it, right. So the knowledge source is the same, but the agents that go that get the way it gets consumed and the agents that. If you're doing multi agent systems that access that information, that part could be different. If you're using a single LLN to do more, the prompt would be different. Or like the assignment of what needs to be done would be different to either function, calling to the same source and then parsing it in different ways depending on who is the target audience. And those could be other agents you could access when required. If you're making a single interface. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Okay. I'm very excited that we're aligned on how to best use your time. Makes me happy that it works for both of us. Okay, wonderful. I'm going to go to the drawing board and put some stuff up, share it with you guys on Wednesday. Avi, we'll adapt to your schedule, and whenever that time is, we'll make it happen. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. So if it's okay, I'm probably not going to be doing regular meetings. I hopped on today because most of the people on my team are in the US president's day off. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Yeah, we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. Thank you for letting me know. Yeah. So, Guba, Henry, let's connect. I'm going to share these notes in the dev discord chat. Let's. Okay. Let's figure it out right now. What is the immediate next step for Kuba to be one step closer to productionizing a few things. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRunning, we've got to decide how do we run it? Do we run it a thousand leads or one lead at a time and then going from there, and then you've got to get the endpoints, like link up the instantly just to test it out. It would be a first good step. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Yes, that would be a good first step. Henry, could you look into the instantly API? Yep. Awesome. Henry, on the instantly API, I will look into making relevant actions into tools for the assistant API so we get a little more flexibility out of this and not just tied to the chat GBT environment. How do we verify we have the right LinkedIn accounts? We'll table that for now, because as we get more leads, they will likely come with that information, if not just the email. And then from there it's easy and running in parallel. Running in parallel. I doubt that's going to be one of our bottlenecks. And then I'm trying to remember the steps of your colab is an environment that we could all access. So if Kuba shares that notebook with us, we can just run it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd it's one of the most reliable ways to run code without having machine compatibility and all that bullshit. So let's keep it there for now because it's working. Let's also think about where are we going to have it when we have it in production, and we actually want to go test it in parallel, et cetera. And Kuba, what do you need? That doesn't mean any structural change. Keeping the flow, the structure and the classes very similar to what you have right now. What is your next step? To level up the system. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHe's moving into Langra. Sorry, there's a little bit of noise here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSorry. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo my next step is moving into Langraph, where I'm going to be using new design edges. So that's what I'm trying to figure out. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, awesome. So Kuba, dive into Langraph and we'll figure out where it fits. Avi, would if you could share any resource of this gated information access that you mentioned for us to look into, that would be awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI don't know if one exists. It was just a suggestion of what to build. I haven't been as involved in this space since. For the last month, almost a month. So maybe there is a tool for it and I just don't know about it because I haven't been in this space. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Great suggestion. Let's look into it because that feels like a very good path to the applications of the knowledge base where one of the requirements would be access this information. This is the only relevant information right now. Or these two sources have the relevant information. Focus on that and nothing else. As opposed to, as you mentioned, having everything jumbled together into one single base. Let's look into that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSimple suggestions for what to do. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou'Re building something automated for the meeting, as an example, the meeting summarizer as an example, you have something that triggers when a new recording gets uploaded. It processes that information, and if it identifies that a specific knowledge base needs to be updated. You could have a separate trigger which could just be a notification, an email. Like if you want a human in the loop, it can be some sort of notification to the advocates or whatever you want that it would like to make this change to this doc. That's an option. But you can go in any way. It could go be as simple as update a spreadsheet with a bunch of requests or send a notification to specific people. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is such a good idea. That is such a good idea. Yeah, because we wouldn't just want the system to decide when the fasterized bio gets updated, but we do want it to get updated. So let it trigger a message and email asking for confirmation of these changes. That's a fantastic idea, dude. Okay, wonderful. That helps bring stuff together very nicely. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. You could also go fancier or less fancy. Like the spreadsheet would be less fancy if you have a doc that gets constantly mapped to a vector database. I don't know if Google APIs supports this, but if it does, for example, Google, when you are editing the doc, has an option called suggesting. I don't know if that's accessible through API. If it is, that's another option. The other is creating Redline docs which is a document where there's some formatting indicating what is the change you're suggesting from the original doc which is redlining it. This is the change kind of thing. Chat GPD knows what that is and can create an updated version of that doc. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo you have this original create a red line version for what you want to change and then it will have a new doc and you can just compare and see if you want to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Okay, cool. Oh man, that's so vital. It's going to be critical component. Okay, we're at an hour, we all have clear immediate next step. Let's reconvene tomorrow for a working session for sharing and anything that comes up. We can continue to chat. You guys, I'm excited to be back and I'm excited to move forward. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMe too. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's do this. Thank you, Avi. Thank you Kuba. Thank you Henry. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-02-19 Dev Meeting - Outreach System Demo V1cleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content='Speaker 2\\nAnd then it print out the similarity score and the title with the header.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNice. What algorithm does that use? Just collaborative filtering.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt just uses pine cone and.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, right, because of vector databases. That makes sense. Okay, cool. So can you walk me through the rag lesson?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I can try. This is one I did a while ago. So when you import the warnings, so you don\\'t see the warnings, and you\\'ve got to import pandas and everything else, and then they give you. What\\'s great about this deep learning AI is they use their own API keys.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat\\'s zoom settings, vector embeddings out of the articles. Then you will look at what search results look like by doing a simple document retrieval from pine cone. Then while working with OpenAI, you will build a nicely summarized article out of these results. All right, let\\'s dive into the code. Now we\\'re going to build a classic retrieval augmented generation.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHey, bartek engineering out of the responses from. Send those back prompt of OpenAI. And get back a beautifully written response from OpenAI.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet me just run loads of it. Max articles. Yeah. So that will give you the head of. So it will set up the database that will give you the head. Prepare the embeddings and upset to pine cone. So I\\'m not exactly sure what upset means, but I think it just means add stuff to you get your prepped array, and then you basically decide what\\'s in the array, the metadata, and you\\'ll see this command used a lot as well, most of the time. So there\\'s the dimension vector count, total vector count. So every time you upset something, your total vector count will go up.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nConnect to OpenAI. And then if were to run a query, \"What is the Berlin Wall?\" After we just upseted a bunch of stuff, it will return text that matches anything. This is multiple pieces.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt\\'s intriguing.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. So writing article titled get Embeddings query.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOk, cool. Interesting, right? Because that\\'s the GT 3.5 instruct.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nVery specific prompt start and prompt end, which used to be one of the pain points of working with these models.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you for showing me that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI\\'m going to go through. Probably do each of these twice just because. Wrap my head around it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, that\\'s definitely one way to do it, especially for that rag portion. And also doing is 100 times more effective than watching. So it\\'s awesome that you have that next to it. So as you go over the second time, how do we level up? How do we implement, how do we apply and apply to what? We\\'ll think about all the documents we have and we\\'ll figure out how all these lessons transfer. And it\\'d be really cool. These short videos we\\'ve been talking about making to be that. To be. Hey, this is what I learned in this lesson, and this is how it\\'s relevant to our company. Right. Instead of the Berlin wall, we\\'ll be asking about this. Instead of these types of documents, we\\'ll have these types of documents. The principles are the same.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo in two minutes we can have the person watching actually get, oh, this is how these concepts work in practice.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Do you have a pine cone API key?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThen? If I were to run it\\'s free. You can sign up. I\\'m using one for the transcript knowledge base system. So that account is now in use and you can just create one super easy and they\\'ll give you a million vectors or something ridiculous. For free.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I thought the pricing was really high, though, on Pinecore.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAfter the first one. The first one is free.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. No worries.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat did you say?\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIn a rush today.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, you\\'re in a rush today. Well, no worries. We will keep this one simple and short. Okay, so I want to give you a bit of a refresher and dig into some of what we\\'ve been working on. Let\\'s first. First, look at this one. And this is something that I\\'ve shown you before, so let\\'s just do a quick refresher. This meeting is getting recorded, and I\\'m going through this system. I don\\'t want to have to go through this system over and over again. So, one of the things that we came up with is creating transcripts and off of these transcripts with timestamps, clean up all the fluff, find the critical parts of this. Say we\\'re here for 30 minutes, only the critical parts, and create an executive summary of, hey, this is how the knowledge based system works, and it\\'s a bullet point.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd that\\'s our contextual executive summary. So, that is the 32nd version of what we have done so far with creating knowledge bases for ourselves. There\\'s another component, which is context. The context of fastrise\\'s story, the context of who\\'s involved, and what each of our skills are. Clients we\\'ve worked with, clients we want to work with. Our ideal customer profile, that\\'s all. Information that feeds into what? Well, that feeds into our applications. So, by having the context of who we are, what we do, who we work with, and having this contextual, summarized information of all our meetings, of each of our meetings, how can we mix those two?\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt\\'s all understandable. Most of it I\\'ve seen already before.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOne thing I\\'m thinking now in high level picture, this is envisioned to be something like a situation in a company that buy this from us would be like, okay, they just want to have meetings, right? And then everything is done automatically. That\\'s the end goal, to have just basically people meeting and then all the things considered on that meeting will be executed by AI.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat\\'s a great way to summarize it. Yeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, that\\'s great. So we\\'re starting from just transcript analysis and then we\\'re building up on top to have something like, I don\\'t know, SaaS product. I see. This could be very expandable.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, exactly. So when it comes to finding the right focus of the product and the fit of the market, that is part of what we are going to be doing over the next few weeks. Honestly, over the next few months, we have some idea of what the ideal customer profile is. Think early, think medium sized startup, remote, majority remote startup already involved in something related to technology. And since they have everything remote, since they have everything on the cloud already, then what a great first few customers it would be for these startups that are already digital. First, we don\\'t have to convince anybody of this is a good idea, just we are able to implement. We have to show how will we do that.Speaker 1\\nHey, you\\'re actually not following the framework, or you\\'re following the framework, but this could be improved. So evaluate the effectiveness of the email. Leveraging the data analyst, making sure like, hey, which of these five insights are actually the most valuable? So to summarize, find the person on LinkedIn. Evaluate which pieces of information about their profile are actually most important and most relevant to us. Create an email. Evaluate the email. Rewrite the email. And when both critic and writer agree, the email gets sent. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBeautiful. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe created an initial prototype of v zero. I call it a V minus one because it\\'s not even a V zero. And it was surprisingly good. Man. It was weirdly good. It was able to be funny, to be direct, but keep it simple, not use crazy language or anything. It was very nice. It\\'s an email like, hey, we\\'re ready to send this email. It was actually really cool. And we haven\\'t sent that email yet. Henry. So we should definitely send that email. Question Bartek. A rhetorical question. The data analyst is supposed to find gold nuggets that are relevant to the email we would want to write. But how does it know what relevant means? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, what if we had a knowledge base that had relevant, up to date information about who we are, what we do, what clients we work on, what kind of products we\\'ve built and are thinking about building? So it has access through this knowledge base. It makes this application possible, not even possible. It makes it so the quality that we\\'re shooting for is possible without this knowledge base, without the context creating this at the quality that we need to create, it wouldn\\'t be possible. So that\\'s how these two projects connect. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. One thing I\\'m thinking is whenever it should be exactly. From the meetings, the knowledge base for the outreach system, I think it should be more of curated knowledge base because I don\\'t think it\\'s like every meeting have impact on relevance to the sales. Right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat\\'s a point that most people have brought up as the first point. We\\'ve developed something to tag the different meetings between general sales, marketing and development and operations. So that\\'s number one. Avi yesterday brought up, hey, when we\\'re actually retrieving information. Yes, when we\\'re uploading to the knowledge base, of course. But when we\\'re retrieving information, if the CEO is asking about sales, we don\\'t really want to step into the marketing knowledge base or the marketing knowledge base. We would want to step into operations because it\\'s the CEO asking and he\\'s asking about sales but not the other knowledge bases. They would just add noise. So that\\'s one of the considerations that have been brought up that was very much on point. What else comes up to you, Bartek? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLet me think for a, I think nothing comes to my mind right now. I think I need to go deep into those projects and have my own some time about it thinking. And then I would bring up something definitely. Maybe we could talk about the stage of those projects. So we push to those. Foul one, foul two for that. Because I see the Asian is already thorough. Like you guys probably think that through so many hours. So to me to put something on top, I would have to really go deep into this. Oh yeah. To the agendic I\\'m thinking we could have more. But the general rule is if it works. So if you guys see that the outputs were good enough or even surprisingly good, I don\\'t think we need to add more agents at this point. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMaybe we could add more agents in the future to make it because it\\'s only adding more OpenAI calls for, let\\'s say 5% better. Something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo it might be not cost effective. And so the knowledge base. Yeah, I would like to see that the project, the call. Maybe then I can have some ideas later. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, let\\'s start there. Why don\\'t the. I\\'m sharing the code, the GitHub code with all of you. Check the discord. So I\\'m sharing the, okay, so check that one out and you can kind of read it on your own time. Henry, there\\'s a lot of things that are not going to click yet because it\\'s the latter parts of development, almost education. These are very technical things and commands that you\\'ve never seen before. And that\\'s fine. You can go to the code within services within API. You\\'ll find all the code and that\\'s going to be python more understandable. Let\\'s see, it\\'s all lang chain. So if you were thinking about getting into lang chain, this would be one opportunity. And as you\\'re trying to understand this, don\\'t read it by yourself. Also use chat GPT to help you. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, obviously I will use PFA for that. Actually, I don\\'t know if you guys aware, but the PFA can be used for everything. Now, the latent space version I use it for instead of normal child GPT. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDude, that\\'s awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLiterally everything I do with AI, with chat GPT I do with. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat\\'s really cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd I noticed giving the non generic content more than usual chat. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGood. That\\'s awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut to this project, I was curious about this, how you guys make the self learning of self updating knowledge base. I had something about that. Is that already implemented or it\\'s just like idea? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is an idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I did do it though, in voice flow. Okay. But that sort of basically just gets chat GPT to answer the answer and throws it into the knowledge base. But what you want to do is you want to iterate it. So for example, it would get the host of the actual chalet to answer the question and then you\\'d get that taken from WhatsApp or something and into the knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt\\'S not that hard. It depends what you\\'re adding. If it\\'s just general queries or if it\\'s, I don\\'t know, something else. But I know the flow in voice flow of how you do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI was thinking that maybe you guys make something like API to update the vector database. So every time new information is ingested by the AI, it would make an API call to update the vector base. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, that would be along the lines of reimagining. There\\'s also part of the discernment, the deciding what is worth adding and what is which Avi seemed to have fair grasp on. And I am sure that we can figure out, especially having PFA, because it\\'s chat GBT discerning. Hey, this is the current, let\\'s say the simplest one. Our project. Hey, this is a document that holds every project that we\\'ve worked on and that we are going to work on or currently working on. During today\\'s meeting, did we talk about any new projects, looking at the transcript and looking at the dev document holding all the projects. Oh yeah, we did talk about a new project or. No, we only talked about previous projects. Oh, we only talked about previous projects and what new about each of those projects did we talk about? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHey well, we found that there\\'s a new client, potential client, for this one previous project. Is that something that we need to add to the dev document? No, because that\\'s referring to sales, it\\'s not referring to development. It shouldn\\'t be too hard. Token consumption is not my worry, especially as cost keeps going down and as Ethereum keeps going up. That is not the worry. And by the way, Bartek, we talked about giving you an API key to properly test PFA to level that up. So hit me up, we\\'ll get you a key and whatever. We\\'ll figure out what that cost is. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBecause. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf that is a blocker to leveling up PFA one more time from what it is now, which I would call, we\\'ve called good enough, more than good enough. If now comes a point where we need to test how thorough, how generalized, how effective it is, I\\'m more than willing to put some dollars into that. But that\\'s just an aside. Didn\\'t want to forget about that. Point being this gated information access is a concept we\\'re going to continue playing with. For now. Let\\'s have a rough V one. Let\\'s have everything, one knowledge base. Let\\'s do it as rough as we can and having as much information as possible in there. Let\\'s put as much noise in there as possible, kind of on purpose, to see how, at what point is ineffective, how much information is ineffective. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAt which point do we need to separate knowledge bases and say, if this is regarding sales access, sales knowledge base versus the one in everything in one knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. For logical thinking, it probably would better to have many knowledge bases. But back to the previous I appreciate what you said, but I don\\'t think at this moment it\\'s a blocker. We can definitely go on to the testing, because this is testing the output prompts, this is definitely useful for us. I don\\'t know if user, like a typical user would like to use the PFA to also test the prompt, or they just get the prompt and don\\'t give a fuck and they just want to use it and whatever to the progress of the mean. It\\'s good to have it, but it\\'s not a blocker right now. I mean, I have still so many ideas to improve it. I have on my whiteboard the whole chain for the process should go. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd I still don\\'t have even time to sit and actually think through this because the problem is that the prompt is so long and so complex. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt\\'S. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nActually being how to say it\\'s tipping my maximal cognitive ability to understand the prompt. So it\\'s very tedious and it takes like at least 4 hours to get in the development end. Okay, so that\\'s why the newer version is not coming, because it takes a day, whole day probably, to make some work on top of this that\\'s already in there. So that\\'s the blocker. It\\'s my time and capabilities. But yeah, I\\'m thinking we could do that. But there is also the subject of ICP and the subject of how we might sell it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, for sure. That\\'s definitely a big topic. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOn the other hand, I think we can just do that for ourselves because the testing will beneficial for us first. Like for the developers. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight? For sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo I think we could implement that on the site and just try using that not really thinking commercial yet, maybe just see how that goes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Yes. And let\\'s also think commercially and we believe we\\'ve had a few conversations already. We strongly believe that short videos showing it in practice, showing anything that we\\'re working on in practice. Quick explanation. Here\\'s the result. And this is why it\\'s so good, is the best, most effective first step towards commercialization of any of our products. It\\'s a very show not tell environment nowadays. So let\\'s do that. A blog post is a great idea, but is that showing or is that telling? For me personally, I do not absorb the sort of almost kinesthetic part. I don\\'t absorb the experience of. Oh, now I understand why PFA is so good by reading about it. But if you show me a video, it clicks a lot more. That\\'s for me and I would argue for most of the world nowadays. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I think I agree with that. Definitely with the younger generations. But the one thing that\\'s a detail, but I heard on the other call I\\'ve been to that you want to make the 1 minute shorts. So there is one detail I\\'ve been known to as I\\'ve been doing some YouTube, not much, but some. And I\\'ve been educating myself and there is a rule because people who watch shorts are most of the time their attention span is very low. So it\\'s best to make those shots around 30 seconds. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNow you\\'re thinking. Yes, exactly. Because we can still do four shorts of 30 seconds each. Yes, you already got it. Yeah, that\\'s exactly right. So we\\'ll keep them extra short, extra impactful. And if you already have a blog, if you already started writing stuff around it, you already have the script, you just remove some intro sentences and you keep one sentence per paragraph. And that\\'s your script and that\\'s your video. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, can definitely think about that. I still have the article for you to read because I wanted to include our little story because I got inspired by the article you sent. They had a story about the pies. You had to have different story. So me and PFA came up with a story that was about the knowledge base and transcript AI. So I make the story that we have a project, we have a very soon deadline, and we had to extract something from the transcript, and we couldn\\'t do that with normal promptings. And then out of nowhere, metaprompting came up and we make PFA. And now PFA got the thing that you were testing it first time. I don\\'t know if you remember that. It got you the prompt for the transcript. That was something you couldn\\'t voice before. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, that\\'s exactly right, dude. It was the audio analysis for finding critical parts of the conversations based on voice inflections. Yeah, I had it in my mind, but I couldn\\'t find the words for it. And PFA found the words and added it into the know. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI think one the article can be about it, but also for the show. If we just recorded your reaction back. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThen, I\\'m pretty sure we have the reaction recorded. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh, so let\\'s dig it up, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThis is why we have a short already. We have a short. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat\\'s my point, dude. So we will get together with marketing people, which right now it\\'s pretty much jorg, and we\\'ll come up with a plan. We\\'ll come up with like, hey, this is the short video series for the ski chalet MVP. This is the short video series for PFA. And we\\'ll keep it super simple. We\\'ll keep it short, and we\\'ll just start posting. That\\'s just where it is. It\\'s a really solid step in the right direction. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I agree. I just have to make new version. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI don\\'t think that you do, Bartech. I think that the new version is a wonderful thing to be maybe showing building in public and doing short videos about what you want to improve. You don\\'t have to show the prompt. That\\'s obviously intellectual property. But hey, I\\'m going to work on this and that, and maybe it helps you. It\\'s a day to start developing one new idea for PFA. The best use of your time, and I\\'m going to let you decipher that. What we know right now is that we need you with us that we need your hands, we need your brain to put some, let\\'s call it productionized touches on the massive outreach system and on the knowledge base builder. What is that going to look like exactly? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI\\'m not sure, but I\\'m going to send you a screenshot of what I showed you and give it some thought, see what you come up with, and we can talk tomorrow and dig further into how to make these systems what they will become, because they are what they are today, and they\\'re going to become something different. And your brain is going to help us make one of those leaps. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, sure, you can do that. I\\'m just thinking, if we need more to look fist on the knowledge base or on the outage system, I will. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet you decide what calls your attention more right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, so do we have a code base also for the agentic system, for the outage? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe will make sure that we get that today from Cuba. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, so I will look into the knowledge base first, and after I have access to no agency system, I will look there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHopefully I will have time for today. Try to make it tight. Okay, we have something more to discuss. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNow, let\\'s see. I don\\'t think so. Just give me a second. Could you share the Google Colab system we have artec map of ab system. It\\'s going to be this one. Okay. So you should have access to the maps that I just showed you on Figma right there. So check the development channel and what else? And then I sent the transcript to Knowledge base project GitHub already sent that. Okay. I\\'m going to pin some of these so they\\'re always available. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOn the finished note, maybe that\\'s not for now, but for the later applications of the knowledge base. Because we\\'ve been thinking internally with Pavlo about something like chief of staff AI, keep us accountable, keep every task to be hanging until it\\'s completed and pinging us around, because there is so much things going on, so much clutter around. And I think it\\'ll be cool if everybody would have AI. That would be kind of, I don\\'t know, maybe some people wouldn\\'t like that, but being the manager of them, everybody should have its own AI. That this is your task for today. The situation in the company is like this. We need to prioritize this and this. You know where I go with that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. I\\'m trying to find words to write it down because that\\'s a great idea. Kind of like a personal business coach. Personal chief of staff is the role. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat does that because I\\'ve been googling that, like who is the manager of CEO and then the manager of CEO is actually chief of staff. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInteresting. Okay. That is one of the big ideas that we\\'ve had that we see immediate use for, which might include, hey, what was done yesterday and what was not finished yesterday. What do I also have to do today and what are some first steps? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, and most importantly, what\\'s the priority? Because the tasks are just 1000 of them. You can just walk 24 hours a day. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThere needs to be some priorities. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Awesome. Okay, Henry, you\\'re working on that course. Bartek, you\\'re going to look at the GitHub and at the knowledge base map and start making sense of it. I\\'m going to also go to the knowledge base code. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I\\'m looking at the transcribe to knowledge base. Are we using agents and what are we using agents for? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInside of it prompts. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo transcribe to knowledge base and. Oh, so it\\'s transcribing. Right. And it\\'s doing the knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. Different steps, because I just whisper for description, which we don\\'t call really an agent. Right. Not an agent with tools, but yes, in that case it\\'s just LLMs in general. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo it takes it and audio transcription, but it takes it and then it goes here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, it cleans up everything that doesn\\'t need to be there. And then it finds the critical portions of the conversations. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, and what does it do with the text file? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight, that\\'s a good question. So I should clarify that it does the exact same thing, but with a text file you don\\'t need a transcription with timestamps because it\\'s just already in text. You usually won\\'t need a semantic cleaner for a text file. And then critical conversation analysis, we could have a step that identifies, hey, these are the important parts of this document or this is the important paragraphs or topics. Or we can go straight into the contextual executive summary. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, and then it upsets that to the DB. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight, exactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, what I think I could do, I want to test pulling from getting the data from the database when it\\'s already in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. If you put the project into chat GBT and you ask that exact question, I\\'m sure that you\\'ll be able to figure it out. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I mean, that\\'s what I\\'ll do. Anyway, when I\\'m going through this course the second time, I\\'ll use our own stuff. So if you got examples of contextual executive summaries, then I can just throw them into an index and test that out. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, you got it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, no, I understand it now. I thought were just uploading straight up text files, but that makes more sense. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo technically we will be uploading straight up text files. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI know, but I thought with timestamps and like. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, cool. And we can debate whether the full transcript deserves to be in the knowledge base or just the executive summary. The executive summary would have to be thorough enough to not have to have the full transcript in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd Nan hasn\\'t worked on this in like a month. What\\'s with Nan and his relation to this project? Is he. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, he\\'s been busy. He has a job. He\\'s working on a manual job. So he\\'s going to be busy this weekend next. And we want to continue this. Obviously he wants to see this through too because he sees the potential of this project. Right. So for now we assume that none doesn\\'t exist and we continue it by ourselves. We come up with ideas by ourselves. We understand the project just like we would understand any other project by reading the code and running it. So I\\'m going to work on some kinks that we can figure out for a manual upload. Do either of you have Ubuntu or Linux? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, but I could get a VM. I could virtual machine it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI guess that would be useful. If you can send me what you find on that, on what VM to use for Linux, that\\'d be useful. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI wish I paid more attention now three years ago when they were showing me how to set up a VM in fucking Linux. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRemember when were talking about the three channels that we absorb information through? There\\'s much of looking and hearing the professor speak and watching them do things, but there\\'s so little of the put in practice, little of like, hey, why is it this even useful? Otherwise your brain can\\'t make associations. It won\\'t be able to remember three years from now. Oh yeah, ubuntu, VM easy. Because you never created the proper associations. That\\'s what with the YouTube videos, that\\'s it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThey\\'re just buzwords to me now. I\\'ll look into it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that\\'s why I\\'m insistent on you teaching us the rag module. Even if just the rag module, that\\'d be awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I think that\\'s what I\\'ll do. I\\'ll do semantic search, rag and maybe one other. But I\\'m going to do the whole course and then go back on rag and semantic search a bit more cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDon\\'t push yourself too hard if you lose interest in the other modules. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, but. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I know you got this. What\\'s up, Bartek? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI\\'m asking if you try to put the prompts from the PFA, the one who just discussed the situation from the transcript knowledge base. If you try to put that in this code, because I see this is the V one of this prompt in here. In the code. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe have not, there\\'s one prompt that I think was passed through PFA, but assume that none of them did, which is on purpose. What happens, how well or how badly does this system work when we don\\'t fine tune any of it? It\\'s something that we need to have awareness of, otherwise when we sell it, we can\\'t have a scale of how good it is. So let\\'s make it as bad as it can be, but functional, which is what it is. You can look at the transcript it created. I\\'ll tag you on the transcript it created with just these prompts. It\\'s fine, and it can be ten times better. That\\'s when we put it into PFA, so we can start that now we have tests of how good and how bad it is, so we can put those into PFA. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, and that also would be a great way to show why PFA is important and why. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDamn. There you go. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes, there you go. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo to run it, we need to run it on Ubuntu or Linux, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNan is able to run it on his end, no problem. And I have a Mac and I\\'m just not able to upload files for some reason. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet me take a look. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo very strange, and there might be some confusion going on there. So that\\'s why we need to have continuity on project. But that\\'s a different thing using. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe file app. Path to your speech. MP3. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI\\'ve had problems with Mpegs before on Mac. Okay, so might be file type, I don\\'t know. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, that\\'s one of the fixes that keep reposed. I\\'ll try to figure out on my end and we\\'ll reconnect tomorrow around this. Just give it a read and definitely take down some notes of what calls to you, what is confusing. That might be start. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think my first commit will be to the readme and I\\'ll add a diagram of maybe a bit more of the flow. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat\\'s a fantastic idea, dude. Yes, that\\'s a great idea. Hey Kuba, how\\'s it going, brother? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we already have a diagram of the flow once. Copy that in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGreat. Idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHi, guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHey, man. Doing great. Doing really good. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I shared the link to the charts. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, nice. Thank you, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThere we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo you should now have access. Check the development channel, Bartek, and you can check out the code for the outreach system. And Kuba, if you can maybe share a screen and share with Bartek, walk him through the code for the outreach system. That will be awesome. In Bartech. I hope that it will become evident how, number one, PFA will be able to help. And number two, how the knowledge base feeds into creating an optimal system, an optimal email outreach. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo, yeah, that would be very good. I assume we\\'re all assuming I need to read it later. Slowly. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere you go. Kuba sharing so you can check it out with him. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHow would I add an image to a readMe? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou might want to google that, but it\\'s not. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI would ask GPT and just pass the URL and it will just do it all for you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, do that. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSome kind of bracket, kind of magic. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe bracket and then exclamation sign, something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThese are the libraries, but. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAgain, can. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou guys hear me? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, it\\'s a little rough, but we can hear you. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, so these are the libraries I installed because I built it with Langchain. So I need to install all these libraries. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo this is API for Langsmith, which is like, to track my logs. Let\\'s go to the code. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIs the line chain available now to everybody or you need to have the whitelist still. I had that on my task list to check this out. It was wide listed, as I remember, in the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGraph, is also widely available. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNow I would finally have motivation to do it, to get into this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m talking about. That\\'s how it works. Finally you get a reason to learn this new tool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAwesome. This is a class for the top three searches on Google. That is what we\\'re using to search for the name of the person. So let me just go. Let me just start from the prompt so you understand. So this is the prompt. So I\\'m giving it a google search tool. I\\'m giving the agent a google search tool. I\\'m telling the agent that given the full name of a person, I want you to get the URL link to the person\\'s LinkedIn profile page, given the name I\\'m going to impute. So I said, your answer should only contain a LinkedIn profile URL. Then I gave you the two. And this is just a chain of thought prompt for it to reason. So this is just the input I need to capture. So this is the prompt template here. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThen I initialized the agent, then I executed the agents, then I just imputed them. Google DeepMind so this was the result. I should use the get LinkedIn. That\\'s the tool that I created. Search for them in Asabi on LinkedIn. Then it gave me this result back, this URL. So I use proxy call. I use proxy call using this URL. I use proxy call to extract data about the person, about demiyasabi. So this was the result. I go back after extracting details about demiyasabi. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIs the extraction happening through some external API? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, proxy call is like an external API just to extract particular details about. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo I created another prompt for the LLM to format the data in a certain way. So I said, given the LinkedIn information about the person, that is like the information I got from proxy core. To extract the following detail, make sure the final output has to be just one single value JSON dictionary without any notes and explanation. Each key map to be a value which is a nested value JSON dictionary with the following requirements. So I kept the phone name, the full name of the person, the introduction, a short introduction about the person, the project that the person has done, the experiences, topic of interest, a list of created icebreaker. So this is just the chain. I do not use an agent for that. I just use the chain, an LLM chain for it. So I\\'m analyzing the chain here around the data. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo it gave me the output, the full name demon Sabi, the introduction, then the experience topic of interest. So now I created another agent for qualifying this lead. Like the information it got, if it\\'s the perfect match to fast, right? So I got faster knowledge base, which is the txe file. This is like uploading it into launching. Then I split it into chunk because I want to retrieve just the very word documents. So I created another tool, which is this for qualifying the lead. If it\\'s like, if it\\'s related to password, if the lead is related to fast price. So I\\'m thinking if we want to be creative, create a very comprehensive knowledge base because it needs to be very accurate when it\\'s comparing the client and our knowledge base. So this is just like the prompt template for it. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo after I qualified deliver, this is the result. Then we establish the perfect smart for our company based on its profile information and align with our strategic goals in artificial intelligence. So that is the second agent. I created another agent for creating a personalized image based on the information I\\'ve gotten about the client. So this is the tool for creating the image template. So this is the prompt for it. So this is like initializing. This is the results. So this is the agent results. I know this message finds you. I\\'m reaching out to introducing you to our company, Fastride, which is at the front of innovation in artificial intelligence, giving you an impressive background in artificial intelligence, neuroscience and machine. So this is just like the output of the email. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThis is the last agent I created another tool based on the email that it\\'s created. If you evaluate it, if it is like, how can I put it? If it is personalized and it is like the person\\'s profile, the person\\'s data. So that\\'s what this agent is just about. After I initialized it, I created my prompt. This is the result. The email is well written, personalized, addressing the recipient background and expertise in a toastful manner. However, there areas that can be improved to ask. Clarity, engagement and relatability identified areas for improvement. The introduction could be more concise and impactful to immediately capture the recipient\\'s attention. The call to action could more specific and component to encourage your response for the recipient. Email could benefit your case. In our fast resolution aligns with the recipient\\'s interest and expertise. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo you suggested how we can make the email better. This is the final. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat\\'s pretty cool. What? I think for this particular stage, we should have also the agent to make a review. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI\\'m not. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNot review, but redraft or rewrite like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. The next step is that. Yes. A second draft. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. And also I\\'m thinking maybe that just will be inside a writer prompt or maybe we can have separate agent for that to kind of make the email more human like human writing. Because while the system is looking very good, if you could, I could scroll up to the initial email output. Little up. Yeah. So for me personally, the first almost two sentences, I hope this message finds you well. I\\'m reaching out to introduce you to company that\\'s already like, probably red flag for some CEOs that seen a lot of these messages. So we would have to introduce some kind of either, maybe even not a human writing level, but some unique writing level, like have some unique starter, because I hope this message finds you well. It\\'s like very standard. Yeah. I mean, I\\'m not here to criticize. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI just want to add some ideas on top of, because it\\'s still good work. And I see it\\'s very prompt to be perfect in some, how to say, polishment. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. And that\\'s part of the prompt tuning. Right. That\\'s obviously like one of the next steps that we\\'re doing. So that\\'s a good observation regarding the structure of the agents talking to each other. Do you think something else could be improved beyond just a couple redrafts for this version? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI would have supported agent for drafting the icebreakers as this is currently one agent extract the information at the same time, in the same step it goes, and draft the icebreaker. I think we should have specific agent for the icebreakers. And the icebreaker should be where the message begin. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, I see. So then, hey, here\\'s the icebreaker. Here\\'s the information about this person, their experience, their posts. Continue, this email. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, something like that. And I had something for PFA recently that I call Persona matrix or matrix. It should be pronounced matrix, I think. Persona matrix. So I\\'m really excited to put this to test with those prompts. Yeah, I think we could make some more detailed Personas in here and separate agent for the icebreakers. I think that\\'s going to be golden. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBecause we\\'re going to just specify one prompt to just do icebreakers. Yeah. And let\\'s have some frameworks in it. Let\\'s have some methodologies how to do icebreakers. Dig into that. Yeah, I think it might require some research on how to do that from how humans do that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nTo make it as perfect. But I think definitely PFA can get us at least the 80% in or even 90% in. And later if we need that few little more, then we can just make some research. We\\'ll see how that goes fit. Like how much really will the separate icebreaker agents improve halting and then we\\'ll iterate from that. I think that\\'s the initial idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI love that we\\'re thinking through it. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI\\'ll definitely read this all at my own pace and have some notes and bring that to you tomorrow with some more thought of ideas rather than just from the top of my head. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI would not like it any other way. Man, that sounds awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. Just to add in the system is just like a sketch. It\\'s not like the main version though. That\\'s what I\\'m just saying. Do you understand? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDo it. Are you asking me or are you telling us? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nNo, I\\'m telling you. The system is just like I said, v one is not like there are still a lot of things that we still need to make it perfect. That\\'s what I\\'m just saying. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI see a lot of fine things to the prompts and make it better so I can get more accurate outputs. That\\'s what I\\'m saying. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat\\'s actually better approach that I\\'m visualizing things because I\\'m trying to be perfect from the start. Yeah, that\\'s a good approach. You guys doing over there? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. And we appreciate your perfectionism because it\\'ll help us get that extra 20, that final 20%. We also want to help you with keeping as effective as we know you can be. And this goes for each of us. Right? What are we spending our time on and how effective is it versus how effective that time was yesterday working on this thing? What we know for sure is that for these projects, any time we spend on them is going to be effective because there\\'s work to do, there\\'s things to improve. And also it\\'s directly related to faster being able to make money in the near future. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes. That\\'s great. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAwesome. I got to go, you guys. Thank you for the awesome work session. Let\\'s reconnect tomorrow at the same time and. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, do we have another meeting later? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNot today. Yes, not today. Okay, let\\'s do this, you guys. Such a pleasure. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI\\'ll see you soon. Thank you, guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSee ya. Bye. ', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-02-20 Dev Meeting - Vector Database course, Personalized Outreach System, KnowledgeNow Earlycleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 3\\nYeah, that'd be interesting. He was on the board of Pepsi and Burger King and the CEO of Holbus and transformed them. He's done a lot, which is crazy.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat an opportunity. I totally picture you, like, asking a lot of questions over, like, two days, and then at the end being like, okay, so here's the deal. This is what we built for you guys.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, definitely. It'll be interesting, though. Part of me was expecting him to be like, sorry, we're really busy at the moment, because, as I said, they're laying off so many people. So it will be really interesting to see what the dynamic is like at the top when they're making decisions like that.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think I'll just brainstorm loads of ideas and what I saw on the news. Like, I did some research on the company, and one of the articles I read was one of the bosses saying, AI won't take over jobs. But I think they mean in terms of customer experience. I don't think there's anyone at the company looking, doing AI stuff.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, that's interesting. What an opportunity, man. Let me know when that is, and we'll prep you with a demo.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo, for right now, we have been diving into two projects. The massive outreach and the knowledge base builder.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I was just doing some of that now. I'm interested in what you're trying to figure out in the knowledge base builder and the problems you're facing there.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere's two dimensions to that. Number one is figuring out Nan's code. And then number two, making it work, because it's not just reading the code, it's making the whole thing work.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo answer your question, Henry, part of what we're trying to figure out in a conceptual way is how do these two play together? How does the context and the company story play with what happens at each meeting? So, what does that look like in practice? Is the context part of a master system prompt, or is that just part of the retrieval augmented generation? That's part of what we need to figure out.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWith the context, when do we need context? If it's, for example, having the context as a tool to use is something, is the way I see it, and being able to know when it wants to use that tool. If I said, how has alejo changed over or grown over a certain amount, maybe then the context is useful. I think the context should be a tool, just like sense.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nContextual executive summaries will be created based on the company context. We're placing the concept that more context is going to allow these active information sources to become more specific. It builds on the story, and that there's coherence because the core story, the core context is always given when created these documents. We need to figure out if it's just a portion of the vector database or if it's part of the initial prompt.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI make the prompt creation matrix complete. It was for PFA initially, but then I thought merging that into the PFA prompt is going to take me a week or so. Why not do it as a separate GPT and call it dimensions? And basically, that's what I did.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI've been working with PFA on the agentic outreach system prompts. For the knowledge base builder, I also got a dope prompt and I wanted to test it together. I wanted to focus on the agentic outreach system because I think it's more interesting at this moment. So let's get this outreach system rolling.Speaker 1\\nAbout what you want to do. Nice. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd also I notice in the actual call up, I don't want to switch to that now because it's just waste time. But you guys probably remember that in the output, for example, the question was missed. It was giving you thought and action in the output of the reasoning of the agent. So I was thinking maybe the chain of thought is not working correctly. But even though we get the URL, so task is achieved. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's just me being perfect. It's just me being perfectionist. Yeah. So always it's good to emphasize on the importance of the bolt and stuff. I don't know if you guys want to test it because we got this thing working. So maybe I just go to the next one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, do test it. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is get URL. This is the person profile. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow do you verify that this is the right person, that this person, if two people share the same name, that you're picking the right one. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, it's actually PFA thought about it. I didn't know if we want to use that, but PFA thought of something like this. This is something that wasn't in the prompt before. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Okay. Let's figure it out. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo if we would have the criteria, because I was thinking for what if we just give the name? So how does it actually verify the name? Let's say there is two persons with the same name on LinkedIn. Let's say. And then which person we want to have, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, go ahead. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm thinking if we want to have this verification, we would need to have some set of criteria how we want for example, we want people from that industry or whatever, or specific role or industry actually can be whatever, but just have some criteria. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, sometimes we'll know the person's company, sometimes we won't. What we always have is our story, the company story, the context, and maybe, hey, between the three of these LinkedIns, which one is the most relevant prospect to us? Fasterize and it has the context of the company story. So that was one way that I was thinking that could be achieved. Regardless, even if we don't have the company name or the email, most times we actually will. Most times we will have the company name or the email of the person. And that's how we could verify in LinkedIn. So I wouldn't stress about this step too much. It's awesome that we have this backup to do, but when I make the relevance action work on its own. Sorry. Not as an action, but as a function call on an assistant API. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI don't think we'll need any of this. But it's really cool that we have a backup. So we can actually use this as a backup or even as the main one if we find it's that effective. So this looks great. Let's try it. Let's see. Let me send you a name and we can test it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI wouldn't test it. Maybe now, because you are getting URL versus getting URL, we get the same result. We would need a test case where we actually have some person that have LinkedIn clone, let's call it. So we need a different test case than we have now. I'm assuming the person we have now, as the input, doesn't have another person who has LinkedIn with the same name. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's what I'm trying to find right now. A name that is popular. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we can do it like this. But I'm thinking also from the way of prioritizing the time, I don't know how much time you guys have. So I still got three more prompts to go over and also something about the knowledge base. Okay, transcript Sandy, you can just leave it as a task for later. I will share these prompts and maybe you can test them later, I think. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, yes. Let me just send you what I found and you can test it later. The name is Bill Miller and there are multiple ones, and one of them is the owner of a vacation rental. So you can check it out there. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right. We share those things on Discord. Or we have some space for this, like a project space or something. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's see. Yes, there is. Okay, there I tagged you cool. So next one. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight? Next one we got as I create the personal profile. So on the left is the version as is. On the right is the new version. It's mostly just specifying more like it's giving your task to extract instead of extracting information. So it's a little more guiding to the AI and also the markdown. The most interesting thing is actually in the next prompt because I took this to the separate prompt, separate agent and show in a second. I'm just thinking if there is something interesting in here because I just make it like 30 minutes ago. So really go deep into what's in this prompt because I go straight to icebreaker prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt seems to be just because in here we have just markdown and little upgrades, but in here we have something more. So we have the ensuring of the final output is single JSon without any nodes. So it's just like strongifying. I don't know if there's a word like that, but I used to think like it's making stronger the instructions. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nStrengthening, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nExcuse me for my English sometimes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, you're fine. We're learning together. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then it's giving another. Your task is crucial for personalizing outreach efforts. So it's giving like overarching goal. It should be also probably headerized like this overarching goal or something like that. Whatever. Overarching next is icebreaker here. We don't have comparison because it wasn't in the as is. So yeah, actually the most exciting thing is how I make it. I will show you in a second. Let's go over the prompt here because this was using this new matrix. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAlthough it doesn't have much of because it was inspired by PFA brainstorming. Like, one prompt was PFA. Let's brainstorm what will be the outcomes of the icebreaker agents scenario. So this is basically the benefits. This prompt still needs a bit of work because this is basically the benefits from the brainstorming. And then put into a prompt and put into a structure. But generally I think it will work great. Just need some little more work to make the more detailed Persona. But in general, I was thinking if should make some communication style frameworks, methods and stuff, cultural, contextual considerations. Also the relevance, the interest based. This is, I think, like types of the icebreakers. So interest based. This is about the communication. Again, there is some examples of some industry trends and stuff. As I'm reading this, it still needs more work. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt was just looking good as the first glance, but it still needs more work. And I really like this .7. Suggestive collaboration. It was based on the idea of PFA. First was to make it like a predictive collaboration, something I really like that finds potential areas for future collaboration or mutual interest, laying the groundwork for professional relationship. So something like expertise aligning with the current project. So, yeah, I think it still might need more deep dive digging. And I will just maybe. Okay, this is also the prompt for the transcript. There is something. I don't know if you want to go over this now. Maybe we'll go over it later as I will dive deeper into the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat was for what. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis one? This is for displaying. It's for the transcript. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, cool. Okay. Did you use the original prompt and put PFA on it, or did you just go from scratch? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's PFA. I'll just maybe share the browser again. Okay, this is the browser. About the agentic system. Yeah, so just to clarify the previous thought, this was the brainstorming. So after it make upgrade like the usual upgrade without telling what to do, just upgrade. So adding markdown and clarity, more emphasis and stuff. I ask it to brainstorm the possible outcomes of icebreaker generation, being separate agent with more detailed prom laser, focusing on communication and icebreaker relevant stuff. I sometimes do like this if I don't want to really think about the specificity of what I want to do, just say something like, give me relevant stuff to something like this. And then it just goes with ideas. And then this is basically those outcomes that got later incorporated into the prompt. So I maybe mispronounced it here a little. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI should maybe specify more that this should be just inspiration and not exactly transferred to the prompt, but I was just making it in kind of rush. So yeah, I will just need to do some of it in the evening. And here I call the prompt creation matrix separate GPT to get that all together and actually is the last message so we can give feedback. I meant for you to inspire from the outcomes after. Also proceed with detail, as in, oh, I forgot pin here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm glad you stepped into multiple agents. Now. I think that it's the way to go. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, definitely. The prompt maximum length was very constraining to me, actually. Most of work was about not giving new ideas to the PFA, but making the prompt optimized so it fit in the 8000 character window. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I often just brainstorm ideas, put some things in the prompt, and the prompt was instead of 8000, it was 18,000 characters. And then I had to trim it down again to the 8000. Characters while trying at least to keep most of the functionalities. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI would very much encourage you to start breaking up into multiple agents because you have some very clear separate steps. Very clear separate steps. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I actually have it on my whiteboard. So this is like a middle of the process we see right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause I plan to make TDD fears, then context enrichment, something like scope, maybe, of the prompt that will give a very detailed process for the developers. But I don't think everyone would like to use it. So I assume everyone would start somewhere in the middle where we have the PFA latent space. So I think it's like an orchestrator, of course, situation after the initial context, where the context enrichment is now in the PFA latent space. But I want to take this function out to another GPT and then the base model kinda will function better because we'll have less clutter of the information because now it has so many functions, so many different things it can do and it's sometimes messing up. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIn here. I didn't specify to make it in the code box and I'm thinking if actually it's looking good, but not exactly as I wanted. The Persona should be personification offer expert. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I have to go. I'm actually going to an AI talk that pages aren't invited us to. And there is a risk that the person that is invited to talk might not really know what the fuck they're talking about. And they're going to be teaching, which makes me very nervous. But we're going to go learn and actually talk with people face to face, which, as I found, is the best way of selling. I'll keep you guys updated on that. Meaning that the outreach meeting for later today, we will postpone tomorrow because we have actual in person outreach to do. So we will prioritize that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's really interesting company. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDid you guys see this? What happened here? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's a real estate group. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I'm excited to tell you guys more about that. What happened there? Yeah. Was it just referring to the previous coded road? That right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhere I give the prompt, I give it the whole cell from the Google collab, so it has a little context on the inputs and outputs. For example, it got some upper. I don't know if we have time for that. You need to go. So I'll just quickly paste it. Paste it in here so we can see it in a full glory. I never seen a prompt like this. This is something new. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYour chat. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf you do shift, click when you're sharing screen. You can do multiple. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou see the Vs code now? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, so we totally got it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is like kind of programmatic prompt. I like to use variables in the prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's great. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is like a next level. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, that's exactly what we want. As long as we find the icebreakers that make sense, that are natural, that are human. We could have a bit of that small, superficially programmatic. But I'm curious to let it run. I'm curious to let it fly and see what cool shit it comes up with as opposed to limiting icebreakers to a certain format. But it is interesting that you're bringing it up the format. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, definitely needs some thought. And I will just merge it with the previous one and see what I come up with merging the best parts of both and we'll see how that's going to work. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Bartek, I have a question. I'm trying to sort of essentially copilot the repo for the audio to transcription to knowledge base project. What tools do you guys use for an AI to look at your whole project and be able to answer questions? Because I get a strong feeling that replit, for example, will only look at the document that you're working on and it only grabs that context. So I'm not sure if I have five files. How do I make it so the AI will answer questions in reference to all five files? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou're referring to having a code assistant in the repository. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt could be that. I just need to figure out how to troubleshoot what is not currently working. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, so you want to put the repository for the AI analysis or something like that? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I think we should try some of the codes assistant because I think the latest version, as I'm aware it was somewhere late last year. The code whisperer or something. The Microsoft one? Definitely. It was the Microsoft one. I don't remember the name. It could be the code whisperer and it has the ability to get the whole repo and kind of read it and understand. I'm not sure if this is correctly exactly this one, but some of them definitely can get your whole repo and just go over it. And for being like, honestly, this repository isn't that big. I think we can just also copy all the code into some. I don't know if it should better. Yeah, first it should better to try the code assistance, and then second, if that doesn't help, we can try to make either. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nJust try talking with PFA, for example, and giving just by hand all the files and have it make sense of it. Or we can try to use rag for that. I'm not sure how better rag would be like vector database. How better that would be for getting the whole context because of the similarity. Do I just evoke the similarity parts to the query and then don't give the full picture? That's what I'm imagining, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it could work, but I would keep it as a tiered option. So first let's go with the AI assistant that can read the whole repo, hopefully. And then other is just so much a GPT or PFA and just giving the files. Yeah. And then third part would be rack for me. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, awesome. Thank you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOne last thing I want to show you is the prompt for comic, the knowledge base prompt. So it's actually your prompt from where you are testing the PFA overseer. So I just got that from that link I got to the conversation and I actually use it for testing at some point of latent space. When it was first version of latent space created, I actually used that for testing. This is actually with the creation matrix. So that's why it's so long, because this is the first output of the PFA. And then I ask the prompt creation matrix to deepen this prompt using matrix. And then it goes to make it like twice longer. Okay. Wow. And it's where more details. There is not only mission, but as I told you, there's deeper matrix. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo in the matrix is mission and it contains purpose, scope, expected outcomes, relevant, sectional, BT. Actually there is more. There's like around six for every header and it's choosing most relevant. And then in here is the relevant part of the prompt. Yeah, we'll have to test that. But also I think there was some magic in the PFA overseer because there was this thing that we are so excited about for the content that you got excited that you could invoice that. Do you remember actually what that was? It was some contextual understanding. Yeah, something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat are you referring to. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhen you are first testing the PFA with this idea? Maybe I'll just dig it up again from our conversation. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat I remember is that zoom thing where it got the audio, the idea for finding important parts of the conversation by the tone of the voice in the audio file. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh yeah, that one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's the one that blew my mind. And that was like the first time I used it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. I'm curious if it also came up with this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I got to go. Tomorrow, let's definitely continue working. Today we have a lot of stuff to do. Thank you for these prompts. These are great. They're going to be super useful tomorrow. I'm going to be working on this company story thing. So we'll get together, Henry and Paige, and we can sort of bang out a conversation in which we just get the story down. It's like, hey, here's the context of who we are. Products we've done so far, products we want to do, period. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSounds good. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI got one question, because I want to deep dive into the agentic outreach system on the call up, and I've seen there is the API key in there, so I assume I can use it, right? I can just run it how much I want and just test. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYep, yep, you're good. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you for asking. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, so I think I'm just good to go. I copied the call up to my account so I can. Don't mess up the main part. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's a great idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I will just try to use those prompts in there and let you know tomorrow how it works. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThank you, guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, thank you, Sia. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSee you, guys. Bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-02-21 Dev Meeting - Personalized Outreach System, Initial Promptscleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nWhat got you excited about AI in the first place? What motivated setting up your AI automation agency initially? How did the formation of the fast track team happen? What key skills does each person in the team have? What were the initial challenges you faced when starting fastrise and how you overcame them? What is your company ethos and mission? How has fastrise evolved since its inception in terms of services, technology, and market focus? What industries is Faster ICE currently focusing on, what solutions have we built so far, and what tangible value do they provide? How do we ensure privacy? What are future goals for faster rights, and how do you plan and achieve them? How do you see the role of AI in society evolving, and what part does Fast Rights play in the future?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor me, it was way back in 2022 November when chat GPT came out, and then I was able to do my homework so much faster. So because of that, I sort of was drawn to the tool and I could suddenly be top of my class without hard work. But it also taught me a lot.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI don't know if I can pinpoint the exact kind of time or the exact thing that got me really excited about it. It was around 2022. Me and some friends were on a Zoom call, and were just kind of messing with it to see what it knew. And there was an island off the coast of South America that had the same name as an island in Long Island, and GPT had no idea about the one in South America. Everything was related to the one in the US. We even gave it prompts about the island, but it didnâ€™t know. We ended up going from GPT to Bing's version, and Bing knew about it, but GPT didn't. It was just fascinating to know one knowledge base has some information and another one has better information.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI initially rejected AI because it's terrifying and I care a lot about people. The first thing that my mind goes to is taking people's jobs and big companies getting involved, money getting involved, greed getting involved, and everyone leaving ethics and human behind. Now, I need to be a part of this to ensure that ethics and people don't get left behind. And coming from education, of course, the first wave of media around chat GPT are students are going to cheat. And then thinking about how we can use AI to enhance critical thinking or develop skills that aren't being learned in schools. Being in education and also seeing the gaps of where education is and where it needs to be, wanting to be a part of bringing AI into it in a productive way, and seeing the access that opens up access to learning, access to knowledge, access to being able to do whatever you want to do.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFor me, it was between 2017 and 2018 when I started learning about how AI could now play video games and be world champions at their own games. That was a light bulb moment for me. In 2017, it was reinforcement learning that caught my attention. I realized the depth that this field had, compared to other fields I was interested in like finance trading and computer science, which seemed a bit monotonous. AI integrates all these cool things that I like, from video games to programming into building actual things, and it completely blew my mind.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo, I've had two agencies. Whilst I was in college, I realized that university wasn't going to be for me. I learned a lot more on my own, and I wanted some way to find financial freedom, location freedom, and time freedom. So I started a marketing company, and I got my first client through a work placement at college. Around the same time, I was also playing around with AI. I found marketing quite monotonous and not that exciting. So when I was leaving college, I decided the best way to learn was by doing. That's where I started my own AI agency, and then one month into that, I found you guys, and we sort of all got talking and started this up.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIn August of 2023, I came across a two-hour video about starting your own AI agency, and it was very encouraging. There was depth, not just an eight-minute talk about AI. It was immediate for me because Liam showed a framework that anyone can follow. I joined the community, and I talked to a friend of mine about it. When I talked to Paige about it, she was very interested and her brain just started going. And something that resonated was travel agencies, though first, we thought of vegan restaurants. We realized that maybe the restaurant industry isn't quite where the money is right now, and we went through several iterations of ideas since then.Speaker 3\\nI think it's interesting that you started with the restaurant industry. What about the restaurant industry? Got your attention and then specifically vegan restaurants from there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow hard it is for someone who, with strict dietary restrictions, to find something that they actually want and finding the right place, or a variety of options, like being able to sit down, opening the menu, knowing that there's going to be several options there. Right. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou won't be limited from the selection. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI see, right. And then we started thinking about, for example, Alejo's brother, who is on the very far end of the carnivore spectrum, and his partner, who is very strict vegan of like, oh, what about partners or families that need to find a restaurant that can accommodate everything? Because there are a lot of times where Alejo's brother is no interest whatsoever in going to a vegan restaurant. He won't go there. And that's just create, they're not the only ones. Right. So how to assist people in finding restaurants that have everything that they want. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I think that's a problem all over the world. And we haven't spoken about this before, but I was in Oxford on Monday, and I was with my sister and my sister's vegetarian, and she's very picky about what she eats. And we had a scenario where she spent ages trying to find a place and we're like, oh, Charlote, please hurry up. I just want to eat. And she's found this place. But then we get there and it's closed, or we find another place and we're like, oh, this place does a vegetarian. But the options aren't quite right. So that's an experience I've been in as well, so very cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's a very real experience. So if you could just chat with a restaurant on Instagram and they actually responded, this would just not be a headache. We realized, well, who is the customer and why? And that's where it started getting tricky, especially with a low margin that restaurants run. So that's when the idea started being less feasible. And then we stepped into travel agencies, because it's like, hey, we're both passionate about this and we know very little about what being a travel agent really is, but there has to be something here. And a month later, the GPT come out faster. ICE had already started, right? So we had stepped away from that, but GPT's come out, and the example that Sam Altman shows on stage is booking a trip. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd were like, oh, man, we're so glad that we just stepped away right at the right time, or maybe the exact wrong time, right? Because again, now, four months after GPT's come out, they give a two session chat, GPT lessons, conference talk, and they didn't even step into GPT. They didn't even talk about GPT and probably accurately, so maybe they shouldn't have. But anyway, it's been growing and that's how our agency evolved. But how did faster ICE come about, you all? Henry, what do you remember? How did that come about? Late October? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, late October. So I just turned 19 and I was like, right, I needed to sort something out, so I was like, what's the best thing I can do? And it was talk to people in the space because all my mates had gone to uni. I realized I'm going to lose motivation if I'm not talking to people doing the same thing as me. So I started hopping in the Discord channels and talking to people and meeting people. And then we all kind of collectively ideated the idea of a lead magnet. They're bringing leads to all of our agencies. And then that carried on for about a month and were working on that. And then some things changed. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSome people had different commitments and what tended to happen and what we saw was some of us were quite full time with the project and some weren't. I think Alejand Page, you can definitely remember being very full time with that. And then I guess we also saw we shedded a lot of skin and we evolved into not doing the lead magnet and becoming faster eyes. And, yeah, it's all been numerous projects since then, and those are great ideas and we're definitely brewing something. And I'm just ready. I feel like we're right around the corner from hitting it big. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat do you remember about the initial creation and the transition into becoming faster? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt was a bit chaotic. I just remember suddenly getting sucked into voice channels on discord and realizing that 4 hours would go by and I didn't even know what we're talking about anymore. But in this space, people were showcasing really cool AI tools that I'd never heard about. That was the first time that I heard about voice dialers that sounded legit, because up until then, the idea of an AI voice dialer was based on my association of what they are now, which are what Zach said on the last call. They're not going to be able to help solve my problem. It's just another annoying barrier that I have to get through. Until this one guy invited a bot into our conversation. And if I hadn't known ahead of time, I would have thought it was real. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nJust the mannerisms, the way that it spoke added some human components, like, oh, sorry, I was on mute. It wasn't on mute. Yeah, it was crazy. And then I think what we learned a lot of is just the challenges of getting a big group of people all on the same page, coming from all different industries, trying to figure out a common thread of a niche that works. And ended up pivoting away from the lead magnet, in part because we split from the guy that ideated the lead magnet and he went on forth with it and we decided, you know what? We're here together. We realized that we're going to go farther together. We all want the same thing. We all have our own agency, and we can do bigger things together. So we've got something good going. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLet's stick it out, let's see what happens. And over time, we've definitely grown smaller, but I'd say we've increased. The quality of people that we have on our team is so high, and that's a beautiful thing. Small but mighty at this point. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd the transition from the initial 25, 30 people to our current less than ten, discouraging at first, because it's like, oh, why isn't everybody just like, in the same excitement as they were in week one? And that's just something that happens. But the amount of the overhead that we had, the amount of time that we had to spend organizing, reorganizing, talking, asking, waiting and waiting, where a lot of the people just fell off and who was left were the titans. Who was left were the ones that's like, wait, I know there's something here. And it deserved a good chunk of my time and my attention and my effort. And I think a big part of that has been the people, has been the small but type community, and. And it. Sorry. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's allowed us to have USAC, for example, come in, and what we thought was what we had going for us, which was a room of 25 people showing to a gen xec. Actually, what we had going for us is the few that were engaged and were ready to blow this out of the park. So somebody, another titan like you, Zach, comes along, and it's like, oh, okay, there's something valuable. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I definitely saw that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI wanted to hear real quick what Paige wanted to add. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOne thing is, it was interesting early on when we had, I would say, about 20 people, and were voting on a lot of things. And one of the questions that we put out there was, what is your main intention for being here? And there were some people who were a part of that group who were straight up, and they were like, I'm here for money. This is what I'm here. I want to make money. And then there were a lot of other people who wrote, no, I'm here to learn. I'm here to grow. I'm here to network. I'm here to build new skills. And that very much informed the mission and the culture of the organization. And the people that were only here for money dropped off. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nObviously, we're all here to make money, and I think there's better alignment of the people that are here. It felt like sort of a natural, you know what? If the alignment isn't there, then it's just not there. We can't force a square hole into a round one. Right. But when we have the alignment, we can move forward on a strong foundation of culture. And the thought that I actually just had now was when we voted on the name of the company, there were probably 2025 people, and I'm wondering if any of us here actually voted for faster eyes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI did. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. I think it was one of my three, but because we had probably about ten different name options and we voted, and were sending out Google forms and surveys probably two or three times a week to try to streamline the voting process, because it was important to us to ensure that everyone had a voice, and it was important that we don't set up a structure where there are executives at the top making all the money, and the people who are actually doing the work aren't getting compensated or valued. Obviously, leadership is important, and good leadership is important. And the sort of metaphor model example comes into mind of the best engineer isn't the best manager, but the best engineer typically gets promoted to be the manager because it's a paid promotion you get. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBut then that best engineer no longer is actually doing what they do best. They're managing people, which is probably not what they do best. And there was a lot of intention around how we wanted to set up leadership in a way that didn't end up with that outcome. And I think we're on the right track. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI have to agree. I mean, I think what you said at the beginning about being motivated by the money, I thought was interesting. And to be clear, obviously I want to, as well as you guys, build a profitable business, that's the goal. But when you guys were in your sort of tumultuous, chaotic period in the transition, I'm kind of also in a career transition. And so I'm talking to Alejo casually about this project that he's starting. And it seemed like every week we would get maybe 2030 minutes on a weekend. Every week there was just insane growth from the last time we talked. Like wild things had changed so much so that I couldn't keep up and he couldn't keep up informing me. And then it got to the point where I'm like, hey, man, we've been talking about this for months. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI know a lot's changing on your end. Is there a place that you think I can fit at this point? I genuinely, and I think I said this, I don't care about the money. Obviously, when it comes to building a business, you want to be profitable. But I'm more fascinated about what you guys are building. And if I can be helpful in this process, let's start talking more regularly because I want to be a part of this. And that's sort of where the jump point came. I think, like mid December, maybe late December, where he said, okay, these are the meetings. Let's get you in the, you know, start talking regularly. And then had a chance to meet Powell and some of the other guys. And every time we had a conversation, I just felt so. I mean, I know that Alejo missed this. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'm sure that you guys all miss this in other jobs or career paths where you're just doing something that, yeah, maybe you're good at, but there's nothing stimulating or exciting about what's happening. And that's what got my attention and the reason that I'm here and want to be here for the growth, because it's exciting. So that's kind of the reason. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's awesome. You're hitting on a core part, which is the human man, human element. It is the foundation of our. We very quickly realized Paige has guided a lot of the search for why we're even here. I guess the story tells why we're here. What she has really helped with is figuring out what comes next. What is the future? And why is the future? You can call it a mission, you can call it a vision, you can call it an ethos. But amplifying the human has resonated with each of us. And it's beautiful what you said. The tech industry has a tendency to go towards more profit at any cost. Be it 11,000 people suddenly get laid off, be it last year, unnamed company goes, we're going to have to do some movements, we're freezing hiring, but don't worry, nobody's getting fired. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd two months later, people are getting fired. The human component that we are fully embracing. Thank you, Paige, for insisting so much. Because this would not have a future if it weren't because we're so sure of the impact we can have on the quality of life of humans. And it's funny to me because, Paige, you started with like, what am I even good at? We had to write two superpowers and hers were blank. I had one which was prompting, and I had a second and I didn't really know. The second one is like, sure, programming, but like a programmer, I've done programming. I know how to use the tools, I know the language is awesome. And suddenly Paige is driving the story and the mission. That's been very special. So I hope you never say I don't know what I'm good at ever again. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBecause the process, some of us have it clearer than others, but it's a process, and it's so enjoyable to be going through that process with you guys. Which brings us to, what are we good at? What are our skills? Henry. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI want to hear from Henry. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. What do you think are your. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, I'm quite young, so I feel like I've got a slightly different, youngest perspective on things, and I think that can be valuable sometimes. But also I think something I've learned a lot recently is my adaptability and wanting to learn. And I feel like I feel quite good at frying information out of people, like wanting to understand and getting what I need in order to learn. So I think that's a skill in itself. And if we're talking fundamental skills, I've kind of know a bit of programming, kind of know some leadership skills. I like to do a bit of everything whilst I'm just learning, trying to decide, but, yeah, I don't know. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou've built some stuff for clients, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd are these, what, lead magnets landing? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLead magnets ad campaigns? Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Thank you for sharing that. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWell, and if I can toot Henry's horn a little bit, something that Liam talks about in that first video that we watched is start with what, you know, start with something that excites you. Start with something you're passionate about. And I think that's why Henry's been successful in finding products or running away with ideas and building solutions from that place. He's super into skiing and he found a way or angle to get into the ski chalet business. He's like, well, I work at John Lewis. I don't need to look any further. And those things can be really easy to. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI have to agree there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think probably two months ago, I don't know if any of us, including Henry, would have conceptualized where he is right now in the process of this potential offer for the product that you've created. And I think it's really awesome that you saw a problem, you saw that you could find a solution, you found it. And then obviously, with the team effort, you're now able to bring that solution to someone that can make a decision. And I think that intuition and the work ethic behind it cannot be overstated. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. Yesterday, or maybe it was yesterday. The day before, I was like, henry just asked the CEO if he could shadow him for two days, and he said yes. And I was, what? Like, what a g move. That's freaking awesome. And I love that you did. That's exactly what needs to be happening. It's freaking amazing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo add to your list of qualities. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMost certainly, Zach, for your skills. For your qualities, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I mean, I've been practicing for this question, right? I've probably done like, 30 interviews in the last couple of months. But I think the reality is, it's funny, I never saw myself as like, a sales guy because of the sort of negative connotation that most salespeople get. But I've been doing it for, and I don't even know why I haven't said this until now. I've been doing sales for almost twelve years, right. In some capacity or another, I've just been doing it. And I've now realized that's a huge strength that I have. And to be honest, two years ago, if you asked me the same question. I probably wouldn't have said that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut now that I'm in this environment where I can help coach Henry and help coach Jorg on outreach and how to be slightly better, how to tweak an approach, that's probably one of my biggest strengths. And then the entrepreneurial mindset that I have to thank my family with because it started with my dad, and then I saw it growing up, and that's sort of just what I subconsciously copied. And now I find it very exciting to know Alejo in this position again. That's why I'm here. I see him with that same sort of entrepreneurial spirit and just being able to run with ideas and create something out of it. So I think those are probably the two things that I would say I'm strongest at and thoroughly enjoy. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is May 2016. I go with Zach after a freshman year, back to his home. I meet his dad, I meet his mom, and the week that I was there, one of those days we drive to this office and he's pitching, showing the business plan to this guy. And that was our time there. I mean, finishing freshman year, like college kids, we could have been doing 1000 other things, and were, like, talking business and going to meetings and damn, eight years later, dude. Okay, enough of ours. We'll have time to reminisce. Wow. So we're talking skills. I know Python. The underlying workings of AIs, of large language models and different forms of machine learning. There's some clarity to me that I have that I've noticed not everybody else has. And I can create an image. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI can actually visualize an image of my head, of the inner workings. I've studied this for a lot of years. Still. I wouldn't put any of that in my top three skills. I think my top three, there's the ability to connect people together, to say, like, wait, I know who knows about this. I know who has a skill. And finding. Asking the right questions to find the right matches has proven to be immensely valuable. And what I want to do, that's exactly what I want to do. That is so what I want to do. Connecting people together. Mmm. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think you're missing one, which is the ability to learn and the excitement for learning, which comes right after your ability to connect people. But it is rare that you find people that want to learn, especially at the level that you do, where if there's something you know nothing about, you will genuinely dive in 1000% until you feel like you're an expert, and then you'll keep going. And that is, I think, an important skill that you possess. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo true. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nEven if it's like chess, for example. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. How did I ever learn so much about quantum mechanics? Right. My God, you're so right. So that's, number two, a relentless leaning towards learning more. And I guess number three, ties to number one, which is human connection. Human connection. That very much allows me to create a vision in my head and share the image with others, but help others feel that vision. So, connection, determination to learn, envision. Agree, Paige. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI played soccer for the better part of my younger years. Twelve years of soccer. Football. And my coaches always used to tell me that I could see the field really well. And I think that it's perspective. And underneath that is what I've recently embraced as a superpower, is empathy. I can truly feel what other people are feeling. I can put myself in a different place and imagine what it's like to be there, which can get very intense sometimes, but gives me a bit of a foresight into what might happen or what is this side going to think about it, what's the potential backlash in ten years? Let's make sure we're not the company that's getting criticized for making robots that take everyone's jobs because we know it's coming and it is people as well. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI've always been told that I have a grounded perspective, and I've found myself in many situations where people just start talking to me and they open up and they tell me their whole life story and they feel safe doing it. So I create that. And what's been on my mind as we've started, this is very much culture. Having experienced good cultures in organization and bad culture, I'm very keen on building a culture where people feel safe. People feel like they have a voice, like they belong, and it gets written off as soft skills and not important because it's not money making activities, it's not the bottom line. But when you have those things, the internal motivation and productivity that come from employees is night and day, but it's not so tangible. I've worked at companies where. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI worked at a company where I was forced to be there for 8 hours every day. It was paid hourly. I didn't have 40 hours of work a week. So I sat there feeling like I wasting my life. I started teaching myself python. I started just, like, trying to keep myself busy. And it's like, I'm doing my job. I'm doing my job very well, but I'm being forced to sit here because no one really cares about anything beyond the bottom line or the people. And I really believe that empowering people in whatever they're doing adds immense value to a company that can't always be directly quantified. And I've seen that with education, too. The same thing happens in a classroom. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIf young people of students don't feel like they can raise their hand and give a wrong answer and not be taken down or judged for not knowing the right answer, if they don't feel like they can ask questions, they don't feel like they can be themselves, then their brain isn't open to learn. So it's culture, it's people, it's perspective. And with perspective, I think, comes seeing like, I'm a really good idea generator. I can see strategy, and I need support with some execution because I don't have the programming background and I don't know Python or anything like that. But the strategy part, I can see the field. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's awesome. That's awesome. It is. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd strategy. Sorry. Is just as important as execution. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou came up with this phrase, this tagline that more and more we realize is who we are, which is amplifying the human. What does that mean? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt means to me, in this world of rapid change, advancing technology, we're all spending so much more time on screens, and it's finding the parts of our work and our lives that we're being. Human matters. We're being present matters, whether that's being present and with a client or a patient or being present with my family, because I have the time and freedom and flexibility to do that, is, I believe, where we find our greatest fulfillment and joy in life, and everybody wants it. And how do we amplify those parts of our lives which are our work? Like our work, we spend at least 8 hours a day in our lives, is a part of our lives. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFinding those parts where being human matters most and using technology to free up more time for that, let's automate the stuff that doesn't really matter if there's a human doing it or not, so that I have more time to nurture a client relationship, to sit down and talk with a patient rather than swipe through 15 minutes appointment slots, because that's what I'm filled up with. And then nobody really feels like they have the time of day. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you. Yeah. So transitioning into the latter part of our conversation, I want to leave that question to that because that was very eloquent. That is exactly. Yes. What we're about, transitioning to the latter part of our conversation, what industries is faster ICE currently focusing on? We've mentioned a few. We've mentioned education, we've mentioned real estate, and there's also one that is evident when you start thinking about it, which is remote companies, within which industry, we'll figure it out. But fully remote companies, because we are one. So who can relate best to them? Who can build the best product for them? Another one, another fully remote company. And there are a lot of those nowadays. So I'm curious about how that might show up in our future clients. Regarding specific industries, education has come up a lot, over and over again. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we kept trying to delay it. We kept trying to be like, well, we get to education from reasoning of there's not much money in that industry. It's not usually high margin, but with online platforms, costs are very low and margins are growing for those platforms. So education has become so much more feasible. And then real estate. We realized yesterday that people in Gen Xers in real estate think that they are first to this technology and they are in their circle. They are first meaning that we are zero. Whatever comes before first. And we can guide, we can educate, and we can grant tools that will allow them to be more human. We're such a human industry where it's all about relationships and you're like spending hours a week on admin bullshit. I'll edit that out of the. But no, keep it real. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's real. Thank you, Paige, for helping me see it, for helping all of us see how we can create an impact. The industry will take the shape that it takes and we can create real impact in human lives. Is there anyone, any other industry that comes up that we have strong interest in? We've mentioned vacation rentals. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, vacation rentals is kind of real estate, but I also see the industries. I feel like I see the industries to come in terms of the massive gap. When AgI is starting to be adopted, there's going to be millions of people left with nothing to do or people that are put on universal basic income and want to find purpose. And that's a whole new industry that will be created. And I think that's where we can amplify the human and help. And I also want to be the voice that kind of explains AI, because, for example, as of like this week, Sora just got released. And if you go on Twitter and you look at the comments, it's all just people are very scared and quite frankly, just ill informed and just acting off of what they see. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo allowing people to make the transition from our economy now into what it will become and what normal lifestyle might quite. It's just Prohuman, really, if we can help with. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. Paige mentioned online project based learning, which is where we hope education will go into. Because nowadays you have the tools, you have the self learning, you have the self paced, and you also need guidance. So does guidance really mean nowadays to have a person who is, by all intents and purposes in that environment, the person that knows everything, that has all the answers, preaching in the front of the classroom? Is that the most effective way for people to learn nowadays, for kids to learn nowadays? So when it comes to education, there's so many branches we're so interested about something anybody would like to add before we move into some solutions we built. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOther than niching down to say that we're at least starting out looking at companies that are medium sized businesses, small to medium sized, because some of the larger corporations likely already have SaaS systems that they're implementing a lot of these solutions within. And there are a lot of barriers that come with approaching companies that are massive with online project based learning. It's what was missing from the workshop yesterday. It's what's missing on most online learning platforms. It's what's missing in a lot of live platforms. There are schools that are set up as project based learning and that's what the kids do all year round. And it's amazing and it's beautiful, but it's not the norm. Far from it. Yeah, I think we can offer that. We can offer it to a lot of different people, of. We can offer it to young people. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI see AI as an empowerment tool of what do you want to do? Because you can create your life and you have all the skills and tools right in front of you. Let's work on a project together and learn together. You can sit here, you can look at these demonstrations, you can hear me talk about it, but if you're not in there doing it, building something that's meaningful to you, it's not going to stick. And that's what that workshop needed yesterday. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. That is what the workshop needed yesterday. Yeah. We have the strategies to make it stick. We're so well positioned to help people really embrace and integrate this into their lives so well, in so many dimensions, in the information and knowledge, in the facilitation, the way to make it thick, the understanding of how to attract people to an online event. We have everything we need. We can help so many people. So cool. And we see the gaps. Oh, my God, we see the gaps. Yeah. So what solutions have we built so far? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nStarting with, we built a lead qualifier initially that will go through a series of questions in a chat format, in a normal conversation, and for incomplete answers or answers that the person maybe didn't fully understand, there's backtracking and the conversation will flow regarding how useful are these answers to qualifying this lead? And we'll go through the full list of questions. That's one solution we initially built. And any tweaks to it can be. We can do any tweaks for any specific use cases, be it changing the industry, being changing the number of questions, the depth that the questions need to be answered at. So that was very interesting to build out first. Henry, what else have we built? And how did you summarize it in two sentences? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's quite hard to summarize. I mean, scheduling assistant was a monotonous task done by people every day, and we simplified that into, quite frankly, just an algorithm that sorts out all the roles and stuff. And what's great about AI is it allows you to talk to these algorithms. So, hey, can we actually do this time with this algorithm? So, yeah, I'd say the scheduling assistant is one I can. But short. I think you're muted, Ella. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMain benefit being the amount of time I get saved on this very tedious task, scheduling 200 employees every day, and the mayhem of waking up with any of the 200, being sick and having to not even recalculate, redraw everything, whole chain of events. Yeah. And we have also built a vacation rental concierge, which 24/7 will help you improve the experience of the guests in their trip. What we specialized it on was on ski trips, ski chalets, and it is incredible. With a simple knowledge base about the chalet, about where they're staying, we can plan out a whole day for them, full of activities, including skiing, of course. We can find out real time information on the ski lifts of different mountains, wherever they can go or want to go skiing, and find restaurants and shops nearby. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we've created some really cool integrations for those three use cases then projects we're working on. Number one, personalized massive outreach, using context from people's socials and recent posts to create outreach that is even the initial prototype. Surprisingly natural sounding and something that kind of, oh, I wish I had written that. And it was quite impressive to have that be the initial prototype. Awesome. We are also building a knowledge base builder that will take all the information of your company as much or as little as you want to give it of meetings with a team, meetings with clients, obviously respecting whatever privacy settings. They want to have new documents, all kinds of documents that we want to get information from. And one of the cooler things that we want to build is gated access to information. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat that looks like is the sales manager asking a question, the CEO asking the exact same question, looking at the same information and outputting a different answer. The validity and truth of the answer is still the same. The relevance is what's different? What does this person care about that is going to make an effective, concise answer. And a million other applications that can come from a knowledge base. That's the one I'm most excited about. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo now I'm going to challenge you to resummarize that in two sentences. And also don't yell it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe product I'm most excited about is a knowledge base builder. Imagine full access to everything that's going on in your company tailored to your position and what you need in that moment. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCan you give me a quick example? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI need last quarter's sale report asks the sales manager. I need last quarter sales report asks the CEO. The sales manager gets details on each salesperson, branch specific product sold, all the details. The CEO gets the execute summary, same exact question. The answer is what's relevant to each of them. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMaybe the CEO also gets last quarter and the fourth quarter of the previous year to compare. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNow we're talking relevance. Relevance, yeah. And what that looks like in each company is completely different. That's why making a SaaS product out of this, where you're just selling it for a subscription and it's plug and play is that much harder. And Google is doing it and Microsoft is doing it within their own ecosystems. You have to have everything, Microsoft for everything to be included. Everything, Google for everything to be included. And how relevant we'll see. They can build great, awesome products. The tailored part is what we can do. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo many connections, so many synopsis. When talking to young children, young people, where they are in their brain development, it's very hard for them to understand abstract concepts and in order for them to grasp it, we have to bring it down to earth and give concrete examples, which is what Zach did when he prompted this question. We're not talking to kids, but we kind of are talking to kids who have no idea what is thinking. Having that in our minds as we explain what these products are, I'm not going to really be able to visualize, oh, having full access to a knowledge base that knows everything about my company. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt's a little fuzzy. Oh. You sign into your slack or whatever portal you're on, and you ask the chatbot integrated right there. I need this. And it gives you tailored data based on exactly what you need. That's the concrete that I think we need to focus on when we're selling this stuff, when we're talking to people, especially, that don't have the lingo about what we can do. It's explaining it in a way that they can visualize their day to day being impacted by AI or some solution. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Thank you, Paige. That is an awesome point. Make it tangible. Show the example. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nMake it concrete. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nConcrete. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd what we've been practicing with. Say this in two sentences, is called economy of language. Your words are more powerful when you use fewer of them. And that's just the math of it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThey also fitness short. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. And you keep people's attention, which our attention span is shrinking, for sure. I'm seeing it very tangibly with young people. My goodness. Their attention span is. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou can blame that on TikTok. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, that's TikTok, and it's happening, too. We have less attention span. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. I mean, so I'm just thinking how all these things are coming around. If you think, what, ten years ago, we didn't have. Just about ten years ago, we didn't have the phone. Then 150 years ago, there wasn't a steam engine. And then, what, 1500 years ago, there was an agriculture. It's all just exponentially going crazy. So who knows? Two years from now, what might the future look like? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. It was a very interesting approach that this speaker took yesterday. He made a few comments about, you guys might not like it, but this is the world you got to accept. You got to adapt. And it was very almost stern, dad, like, toughen up. This is how it is. You got to get on board or else you're going to get left behind. And it was like, okay, I hear you. And also, interesting approach. Yeah. And it's true. I mean, it's true what he's. It's. It's inevitable. And we can embrace it or we can let it pass us. Things. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThere's a Alex Friedman podcast from, I think a few weeks ago, it might have been the one with Elon. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOr. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMaybe it was Zuck, but he talked about how, kind of, for the last 500 years or so, there were revolutions, like sort of every century, and we're at a point in time now where those revolutions are mostly technology based, and they're happening every year now. Like, went through AI we're still in it, but it's active. We're now going into what Apple's calling spatial computing and virtual reality. That's a whole revolution in itself where you can do Iron man shit in real life now. It's fascinating how quickly the revolutions are now happening. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I think one of the things I was reading about recently was in San Francisco, there was a bunch of people that attacked a autonomous AI driving car and they set it all on fire in revolt of AI. So it's scary to think, and then what's logical is then using AI to contain the situation because it's the most effective way. And I can only see that just creating mess and that would be minimizing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe human as opposed to amplifying. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo educating is one way to amplify then. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo the speaker, Chris yesterday showed some photos of himself going to the Apple store to try on the new apple goggles. And he was sharing a little bit about his experience and I've never seen anything like this and whatnot, and then showing the use cases for it within the real estate, which is now. How much time would you save for yourself and your family if you don't have to go for 15 houses in person? You can put on a headset and do a virtual tour. And there are companies that are already doing that for the real estate business. He had a couple of websites that he shared for tools around that. But it's interesting, like, oh yeah, that's way more convenient. I don't even have to leave my house. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd then on the other side I can also see, like, I don't get that feel. I don't get the kinesthetic feel of the house. And I haven't experienced the goggles yet, but I'm sure it is very real feeling. But there might be other people that prefer being in the space and feeling the energy that lives there, because that's also a real thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd let's definitely not take that out of the equation of buying a house. Of course. What if you can sift through ten houses and then go feel three of them? It's like, oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense for everyone. As opposed to spending ten minutes in the ten houses, you can spend 30 minutes in each one that you have some intuition could be the ones. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. It's interesting because it could be fully virtual. But if we keep thinking how do you amplify the human feel? Then the average are right in front of us. The experience of the human. And how can we amplify that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, not only virtual tours, but how could that help with amplifying the important part, which is I do want to spend 30 minutes checking out this house and sitting in every room and as opposed to being rushed, because I got to go check out the next one. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, it's exactly what you're saying. You spend more time with the human, the agent in the houses that you've already gained insight on that you're actually interested in buying that further qualifying the lead. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI wanted to ask. Sorry, go ahead. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I got to go. I have another call, but. Yes, go ahead. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWell, I was just going to say, how do we ensure privacy, sort of, before we exit this conversation. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, there's two ways. Three ways. Number one, Microsoft Azure, the Microsoft cloud platform called azure is the industry standard. Everything is tunable through settings. That's number one, how do we ensure we go with the industry standard? Number two, when it comes to AI, there's two ways. One, that requires trust, which is through OpenAI, fine tuned models that data never gets trained on. For OpenAI, this is all part of the policies and things that they have touched on again and again. There's a button chat GBT that you can click and it's like, don't train on my data and won't. The trust component is you are still sending that information over to a server that is not your server. So that's number two that I trust, but I can't assume that others will. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe policy is there's buttons that say, don't train on my data and that doesn't get trained on. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhen you're talking about building fine tuning models, that's by default. And then there's number three, which is a local model. It's not OpenAI, but just call it an open source model. Everything gets computed in your computer. Nothing ever leaves your computer unless you explicitly create a function that sends information somewhere. Those are the three ways that are the clearest, most accepted ways to ensure privacy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo from my understanding, in a real world example, an HR department for General Motors, they have health documents for thousands of employees, Social Security numbers, addresses, all that kind of delicate data. From their perspective, the most valuable way to have a system that we can provide them but still keep privacy at a number one is a local model. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCorrect. Perfect. And General Motors can pay for it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDefinitely. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBecause they're expensive. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nVery expensive. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, they're very expensive. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSomething this brings to mind what were talking about yesterday when were talking about creating our vector databases and access levels. Within the rag, like, who can? The CEO can only access this data about the company and whoever else can only access X. And I think one of the strongest things, I think, is just trying to jailbreak the model yourself, because if you try to jailbreak it, you'll eventually find out if it's secure or not. There's many funny examples of chat bots on the Chevrolet website where it's just like, I remember the example, but it was a funny one to drop it in the chat. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI can give one. I've been doing interviews with them, and their second round interview is a chat bot. And I actually broke it because I didn't have audio for the first two videos, so I had to redo it. The questions changed. They were different. They asked me a question. I recorded a three minute video submit, and then it goes into the ether. They ask me another question, submit, it goes into the ether. But if I reset that process, it has to be done by management. Then it's different questions. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Yes. Okay. When it comes to, I think you got a right, we have to be very careful, and we have the right people to ask, too. We have the right advisors for that, and we also have the people to build it, which they're not in the organization right now. But the time will come where we'll be building local models for high ticket clients, high ticket organizations. And in the meantime, fine tuning OpenAI models that are privacy proof. I'll vouch for that because it's the only viable option. And you can have a discussion about how might break it and steal information or use that information unethically. Let's see. Shut the hell up. That's amazing. That's a legally binding. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWow. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCrazy. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBro. What did you ask? What is before? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm just finding there's so many bad ones, but, yeah, they must have had it open for like, a day. I'm just finding images. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is wonderful. This is great. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut it's so obvious to me how that happened. It's just they uploaded chat GPT into the. All they did was add a system prompt, and the system prompt was probably quite bad. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's great, man. Okay, I got to go. I'm glad we did this, you guys. This is fuel. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMe, too. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFor the future of best rice. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIndeed. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIndeed it is. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, I'll reach at 230, right? Or in an hour? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. Perfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPeace, guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSee you all later, guys. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-02-22 Fasterise Storycleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nWhat are you asking about for a website?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSamantha.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nZach offered some coaching on video making.

I think he's definitely onto something with that being a very effective method of outreach, because you just have to do what the market is asking you to do is just be genuine. Just send the message you want to send and see who resonates. And also, it needs a little bit of work for sure, which is a good thing, because we're able to identify how we can improve this. And it's awesome that Zach is also here to help out with perfecting our demos, perfecting a little speech, and embodying your elevator pitch, which we got asked about yesterday. And it's kind of like, how do we summarize it in one sentence? And part of what we came up with is amplify the human, which is the tagline in our website, and it resonated with people so much.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I'm going to an AI event near me because Microsoft had one of their headquarters near me, and there's going to be a talk on vector databases and other topics, so I was like, I'll just go.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's perfect.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe have to figure out, as we start doing ads on LinkedIn with those credits and stuff, where do we send them? We could send them to our website, but that is a dead end.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe should just make a landing page with that chatbot on it. It would be best if the landing page is just the chatbot box in which they talk.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat makes a lot of sense to me. As we step into trying to prove what works and what doesn't, it's evident that people need help with marketing. At yesterday's event, a couple mentioned marketing, mentioned website. But beyond just yesterday's event, so many people need help with figuring out their marketing.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMarketing is great, but it's also expensive. For example, if you want your product to sell well, the easiest formula is to do UGC. So user-generated content is pay creators on TikTok or to, they don't even have to be like famous creators.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo how much money are we talking about for an effective campaign?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt depends. Local ads are a lot cheaper than broad campaigns. It also depends on what they're trying to sell.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMaintaining a presence on social media is extremely time-consuming, and going over how to automate social media posts was like mind-blowing to them. Just using chat GPT and some of the integrative features of chat GPT.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nA solution would be using a platform like go high level. It's used by many realtor companies and you can automate all the media posts.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe other thing is that most of them already use some kind of CRM to manage their clientele base. It depends on if they're affiliated with an agency or if they're a freelance agent. Some of them were interested in integrations with the existing software platforms that they're using.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDo you know the names of the platforms?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe main one was RPR. Follow up boss is another.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAutomating posts, we could set up a go high level account just to do that. It's best to use a tool that's already existing than to build out whatever solution to do that.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThree things that came up were, number one, marketing. Number two, consulting calls to offer an AI audit, a deep look at their business.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBeing able to automate keeping track of new listings and then communicating that to clients is crucial. So something I'm imagining is I have my clients profile, I have their budget range right into their dream range. And every time a new listing pops up on a website, an automatic message or something goes out to the client that I'm working with that fit that description with maybe a little personalized touch from me to let them know about the listing.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt goes back to knowledge bases, right?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet me share my screen. This was something Edward wanted to provide for realtors, and it was very cool.Speaker 2\\nI can't imagine for someone who's starting out. And then he did that the first time, and apparently, and then he did the exact same thing the second time where he just like did a tsunami of tools in no particular sort of order. So he was like, transcription tool, here it is. And then five tools down, he's like, oh, here's another transcript ##cription tool. There wasn't like a slide with, here are the three tools for transcription. That level of, well, yeah, that level of non clarity. So then when went up on stage, I think what we tried to relay is like, this is how these things play together. This is why getting custom instructions on chat GBT is valuable, because now it knows things about you that it can do, that it can go off of. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo then when we started talking about just very briefly or conceptually about knowledge bases, like, hey, that thing he shared about how can I describe my whole business and have a conversation with Chiji Pt? What questions would you ask me for me to be able to describe my business, answer those questions, put them into a prompt, and that's your system prompt. And we try to knock these things together. That thing that this guy talked about, that's called your system prompt, your context, how does that play in? Well, you're trying to do social media posts and you could start from scratch and just ask for something, but usually it's going to get the same generic post that 1000 other people have already gotten with the content. So trying to tie things together, it was a fun experience. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBefore the talk even started, our website was already on the big screen. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI saw that picture. That's fucking awesome. That they recognized, and even beyond recognizing, they allowed you guys to come up and speak and provide real, in a different version context to the stuff that this guy was sharing. That's really awesome. So who put this on? What was the organization? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMy cousin and my aunt work at a mortgage lending company. My aunt is the branch leader and they're the two top mortgage lenders in the state of Maryland. And a lot of their business is people to people. They certainly get people in from the agency that they work with, but they do so much for client retention and referral. Like, my cousin will send out Valentine's Day gift boxes, like her and her real estate partner will send out gifts to their clients or past clients, probably four or five times a year. And she was saying something like loyalty. Right. If there was an automation of like, oh, this came in and this. Now we send a thank you letter, or now we add this person to a list of who we need to send this to would be really helpful for her. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOn another note, we need to be doing this because we can do it so much better. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, conferences, like workshops. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, yeah, we should be doing it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, my God. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis guy had energy, he had charisma, but, like, I could sort of sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt in a description. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd especially from the lens that we came directly from Bermuda, which is like public speaking boot camp. It's just he mentioned, oh, this is going to be interactive. It wasn't interactive. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, my God. It was not interactive at all. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPeople need. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat was one of my questions. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I'm imagining if we could spin this as like, use AI in your business or start your business with AI, or integrate your business with AI, and it's mostly crowdsourced of like, okay, let's think about the three biggest pain points. Now we find the common thread. What's the biggest pain point? Let's solve this together. This is how we're going to do it. Everyone does it. They leave the workshop with essentially a mini solution that they can implement right there. And they come back because they want the bigger integrations and that's where the money is. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nNow my brain is turning. I really like this. Yeah, that's a really good idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBuild in public, right? That's our whole thing, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBuild in public. It's free value and we're giving them stuff that's already available. We're just helping them put the pieces together. And then when they're ready to take it to the next level, it's like, let's go. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nReady to roll. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe've also talked about getting back in contact with this guy, his name is Chris, and working out some sort of deal where he refers people to us and anyone that books something with us, we give him a finder's fee for because he's like, I don't really people. He's just word vomiting tools to everyone. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI believe you. I've been in those events. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPeople, they're craving it. They want it. And you realize how much of a bubble we're in by this population. Interested? They're showing up on a Saturday, I. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGuess it was Tuesday. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThey're showing up on a Wednesday to this workshop, which is for free, because they want to learn. And what I think would have been really valuable is if they had walked out of that room and had half a solution already implemented, or at least been working on it themselves, and they didn't. So now they have all these resources. But even as someone who's familiar with a lot of these tools and has an above average understanding of how they work, I get overwhelmed by, like, I don't know which video editing tool is best. What do I use? You have to pay for everything. I'm not going to pay for everything. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nRight. Which, by the way, since you mentioned that I have the Adobe subscription for the suite, so welcome to share that, if that would be helpful. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat would be very. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou could, barring money aside, if you could hire someone to do something, like, what would it be? Would it be admin? And almost all of them shook their head yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, my God. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. It sounds like it's admin. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd the response we got from a few of them was that I feel like I'm always behind. I never feel like I'm caught up. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's interesting. It's terrible for a business owner, but, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, in a lot of agents, it's a hustle business. You might have an agency, but in large part, up to you to bring clients in the door, which means that your social media presence and your presence online is important. That alone takes a lot of time, let alone showing houses, managing the listings, walking your client through the whole process. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt's a great opportunity for building rapport as well. And it's quite funny, because one of the things I was talking about at my work when I was thinking of stuff was, I think I said to Alejo yesterday, is when I actually teach them something, and then they'll happily buy the computer. If I teach them how the CPU and the Ram works, then they'll buy the computer. And I was thinking, because I'm potentially speaking to the CEO of John Lewis, I was brainstorming ideas. One of them was, just be able to teach them about AI, because I know, for example, we have areas in the stores where, for example, they'll do a fashion area, and there'll be people that come in that they sit down on the chairs and they'll have someone talk about fashion and how to make dress and stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut what if you just had AI, for example, if you just had a school with chat GPT on it and they could just go try it out, they'd be so interested. It's crazy because also the audience for that store is probably around 30 to 60 and over. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. One of the guys we talked to, whoever his contact information, who is, I would say he's in the early adopter, he's already implementing a lot. He sees the value and he said, I see this. I'm predicting this trend where with all the increase in AI tools, there's going to be at least a very sharp increase in people wanting human connection because of the lack of trust that comes from deep fakes online. How do you know information is real? So in this AI increase, now there's this trend towards, I want to talk to a human because that's who I can trust. So finding those human touch points like you're saying in store, Henry, I think that's brilliant. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I agree. I think sort of the other side of the coin when it comes to the human interaction and I do this, I find myself like when I have to deal with customer service, with T Mobile or whatever, I'm going to be on the phone for 45 minutes. I just have to sit down and deal with it. They've now started to give the robot option. The reality is most people, when they get that option, it's not always a trust thing first, it's more. I already know this robot is not going to be able to solve the problem because it's not trained. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBut if it's a specific solution that is trained and can solve any problem that a human would be able to, I think that really helps with the trust factor, because now you can trust that this AI is actually going to help you as opposed to wasting 45 minutes of your time collecting your information, sending you to a human to solve the problem, and then they have none of the information that was collected previously. So it was just a complete waste of time. So the efficiency of that solution actually working, I think is another big piece. And so in store is a really great opportunity. You can train it about ten new products, new line of hoodies. Right? What colors do you have? What sizes do you have, what fonts? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou can easily train the bot sitting there on a screen about that stuff and allow someone to. Just, what colors do you have? We have all these colors. And if you know, there, these colors are limited, blah, blah. That would be a really great implementation in store. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nA bit of a tangent, but. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, one of the things I do worry about in store is they don't want to replace the human work. So, for example, great. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut that's all they want to do. Just fire them. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's what I want to do. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWell, for example, well, the head of the business, not the guy I'm seeing, but someone else went on public, released a statement saying, we're not going to let AI take over the customer experience. And that kind of makes sense. These people are deciding in our era to actually go into a store to shop. And John Lewis is kind of like known for the customer experience. So they normally go into the store expecting to speak to a stylist, expecting to speak to someone who knows about, and quite often I'll be serving someone and they'll end up just talking because they're older. They just want to talk to someone. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo that's where your pitch comes in, and we can talk about this more during the outreach. So your whole thing, Mr. John Lewis, is the customer experience and making sure that it's top tier. Why don't we take AI and not touch the customer experience? Let's touch the employee experience. Make that as great as it can possibly be with scheduling with a knowledge base, whatever his pain points are, in this case, scheduling, I think, is where we're starting. That trickles down to your customers. Your employees are not stressed out because they knew that they're working this shift. They're not surprised because they're not working ten shifts in a row. Whatever it may be that improves your customer experience. That's what you focus on. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFour employees managing a schedule right now. That's four employees that could be out on the floor boosting the. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDamn right. And Henry, we got to go the route of, as Paige very wisely says, the beginner's mind. So grab a notebook and only questions. I have answer for that. And this opportunity for you is an opportunity of year long relationship. Of decades long relationship. So your objective, Henry, is to come across as coachable, which we know you are, and curious. Coachable and curious. And then the following week, it's like, hey, we talked about all this because you have your notebook. So you took all the questions and all the notes, and he sees you taking the notes, and the following week it's like, hey, I came up with this and this. We actually built it. Who do I talk? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I definitely see. Yeah, I don't want to go in there thinking I'm some big shot and I'm trying to sell him on whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt's not the right move. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAt your age, and Zach knows this, at your age, I was ready to leave college, sit down in an interview, and it's like, so why do you see yourself in this? Like, no, this is not a job I want. I want your job. Yeah, bro. That level of ego and unawareness of what I learn. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd you can still think that, by the way, you just can't say it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, of course. The illness of the advanced practitioners. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo, Henry, I think either later today, tomorrow, or maybe even some point this weekend, I think it'd beneficial for you and I. Obviously, everybody's welcome, but to have, like, we could do kind of like a role play where I'm John Lewis, I ask a bunch of know and just kind of go through what a conversation structure might look. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHe's not. He's not actually called John Lewis. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI just assumed. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNish is his name. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, nish Kankawala. So John Lewis has never had a CEO before. It's always been partner owned by the employees, and it was founded in the 18 hundreds. So it's a very old british middle class store. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nReally. So the brand is John Lewis? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, the actual store, the brand is called John Lewis. And then they partnered with Waitrose, which is kind of a Walmart but not a Walmart. It's probably a bit posher than Walmart, like that description. So they do a supermarket and like a. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nGentleman with some partners. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInteresting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHenry, are you familiar with the british bank, the oldest bank and the most loyalty sort of focused bank in british history? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nExplain a bit. I know a bit about how. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThey stayed so in the past that their accounting and their accountability was just a matter of trust of people. So eventually they handed a lot of power to this really good trader who was making millions of dollars trading in the stock market. And this is in the year 1990, 719 98. They move him to Singapore and they give him, I don't know if it was like 30, $40 million to trade with. A year later, he's $75 million in the hole. But the accountability was fictitious, so he had to cover it or he was going to get fired and never get a job ever again anywhere. A year later, he's $300 million in the hole. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHoly shit. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n$300 million in the hole. And an inspector comes to the offices to check all the numbers and we're talking like paper, printed paper, all the balances, all the accounts. And he found a way to hide the account, but not quite that an inspector wouldn't be able to realize, wait, there's something fishy going on. And they did. They realized, oh, wait, there's something fishy going on. But they just closed the case. It was all good. It was just a routine audit. I guess time ran out for the inspector and they closed the thing and they left. They went to the next poor guy that was covering accounts anyway. 2001 hits, dude, the oldest bank in Britain. All the rich people had their money there. All of them. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think it was like something ridiculous, like put $2.1 billion in the whole, man, and the whole bank went back, went bankrupt. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nJesus. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt is fucking dark, dude. It is. Yeah. So when we look at companies being like, well, we don't have time to go organize our Google Drive. We have to go focus on sales. We have to go do this. We have more pressing matters. And they just let shit pile up and pile up. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's why they never feel like you were saying. They never feel they've, on top of everything, caught up. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo the employee experience is what gets harmed. It's the Nike programmers spending hours per week just trying to find the documentation. Dude, who the fuck built this program two years ago? Who the fuck is whatever? With a title that then you click on the profile, it is inactive. And that documentation didn't automatically get inherited by someone else. How do you expect to run a company that way, dude? And that shit piles up. So when Paige said admin and everybody's head nodded, it's serious help that they need because it compounds to become worse and worse and more annoying and harder to fix. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo we have something that can save them a lot of everything, a lot of money, a lot of time, a lot of stress, and help them focus on what they need to focus on what they saying they need to focus on, which is amplifying the human. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI just thought of a weird. Not weird, but sort of a new line into exactly what you're talking about before COVID everybody, when you walk into any office or any place that has executives or corporate people, there's always secretaries or admin folks. And a couple of times I've seen two or three secretaries at one desk. And then COVID happens, they got to cut the fat. And those are the first people to go. And in a lot of cases, those people are doing this admin work, this organization, making sure that the executives have the information at their fingertips. Most companies still haven't replaced those absences. I still go into companies that have a beautiful lobby. Fantastic. No one's sitting at that desk, no one's answering the phone, no one's keeping track of incoming information. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo I think that's another value point in the sense that we know companies cut cost and they had to. But it's now time to replace those folks with a new solution, because otherwise you're going to end up in the same position as Alejo was saying. You're going to lose customer experience, and they already are. The fact of the matter, someone's not answering the phone, their service or their sale isn't happening. It didn't get to the right person, but they never know because it never got to the right person. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. That's crazy. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo let's do what the four of us do best, which is people. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I do want those events. Sound great. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo now the when and the where. What's the idea here? Who are we targeting? Why are we targeting them? I think real estate is a great place to start. You guys have already done one kind of impromptu we have partner with that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHas the specialization in real estate. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think the easiest thing to do is build, like, a lead magnet. And that lead magnet is our talk. And then at the end of the talk, you go, like how you said you want them leaving with the first step into their solution. By the end of the talk, they're leaving with, okay, I know I can use Alejo and that's help to do this. And then maybe we upsell or maybe we just straight sell them from there. But I believe you two could probably get that same audience at. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Yeah. Zach, how familiar with the real estate industry are you? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWell, I was actually going to mention to Paige that at some point I'm going to have to call one of your family members and get on a fact finding call because I am trying to buy a house. So in the last year, quite familiar. I think I pretty much know everything I can without talking to an expert. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. That was my honestly expectation. I didn't expect anything less from you. You know me, buy a house. Let me go understand the depths of this industry. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. As much as I possibly can. Again, without talking to an expert. But that's the next step right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, we can definitely hook you up with my aunt, my cousin. Definitely get that going. We're going to sit down with them and have a deeper fact finding call. One of my cousin's best friends already offered herself up without any prompting. Be like, I'll be a test case you can use. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nJessica. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nJessica. Yeah. So I've got some follow up work to do to see make the most of the next nine days that we have here in Maryland to get some in person meetings, at least some consultations with folks. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAwesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd if we can get a system together that works for one, it'll work for a lot of them, and it will spread like wildfire. I think that and getting together workshops where we can do what we do and get the human touch and teach people and educate. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI also see room for growth in this as well. You two are perfectly trained to train people to do workshops as well. If were to grow. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, I half the way I wanted to be like, hey, do you guys want facilitation training? Because we can up level these workshops? A. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSure. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNow I'm wondering, too, because we've been talking about building a base for a knowledge base with my education company in the vein of what Alejo is talking about, of our Google Drive is so unorganized because it's ridiculous. And my partner mentor boss needs an upgrade. She'll work on a word document and then forget to put it in the drive and then get frustrated and send out of us a bunch of messages because she can't find anything because she's not working in one yet. Yeah, it's a mess. And then it feels like everything's behind. And I bet we could figure out a trade of some sort where if we build a sort of prototype knowledge based system for them in exchange for some leadership coaching or, oh, my God, training. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's such a good idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhether it might be when we're doing pitches or in these customer calls, I think it can be a really good value exchange. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLight bulb. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, it's valuable training. It really is. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, it is. Being able to get up on stage yesterday, impromptu, we didn't know when were going up at the beginning of the call, when were talking to him and our website was up, he's like, yeah, maybe you want to come up and say a few words later. And halfway through the talk, he's like, oh, yeah, we actually have people from other country that are building this. You guys want to come up? It's like, oh, now? Sure. Yeah. And, dude, we felt so ready. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt felt good. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt felt like, oh, yeah, we know exactly what the fuck we're talking about. There's nothing to be nervous about. And we know the value that we can provide. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI'm very glad you're a better public speaker than Sam Altman. So that's good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBecause you will never look at public speakers the same. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Disillusionment is the first sign that you're learning about public speaking. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's funny. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLifelong journey. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCouple notes. Yesterday was great. We're going to follow up with these people. Live events is where the fuck it's at until we can make our own live event. I want to show you guys a framework that you may or may not be familiar with, but has been very useful to think about for marketing. And I'll show you guys the rest of this in a second. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNvidia has gone up $100 today. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. BCVE is branding, community, virtual event. And then there's live event, which we're going to not do for now. Branding. It's our videos, it's what we put out, it's our brand and the digitalization of who we are. Community, a way for people to channel from our content to a place where they can interact with us or with others into virtual event. Like an online conference. Like online conference for realtors, where we might intro an expert like Chris to talk ten minutes about the state of real estate, the challenges of real estate, and the opportunities, and then back to us where we're like, hey, and these are some solutions we've created for this and that. However, you need something different for your business. What is that? Set up a consultation with us. So the fuzziest part, these feed into each other. This is a sequence. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo these are a sequence. We're going to keep live events out for now from our branding and content. How do we step into a community, into a live interaction of some sort? And then for a virtual event, even just that concept that I threw out, there could be a great first live event with expert in real estate. Bam. With expert in AI solutions. Bang. Join us at this virtual event. So landing page. And I'm sure, Henry, you can picture the funnel landing page. This is a framework that is so straightforward. And what this guy that we talked to that has been in this space for so many years, kind of the framework that he landed on, that he's seen be most effective. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd he comes from the age of ten years ago where just a decent looking website got you leads, and he has had to battle through a transition in digital marketing where that is just not even close to enough anymore, and that this has proven to be an effective framework. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI agree. The first thing I think of is going live on LinkedIn once a week and maybe adding some structure to it, where once we build a little following, I'm not looking at the LinkedIn page right now. But maybe this is where we use those ad dollars to promote these live events in order to bring in fresh faces, the people that we've talked to before for experience and start to generate leads through live events on LinkedIn, which is free and easy to do. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I love that. That could definitely be where we spend our ad dollars. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe LinkedIn specifically ad dollars. I wouldn't necessarily go much beyond. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we have those credits. Yeah. So, you know, it's funny, people kept saying that the real estate market is saturated for AI because that's one of the first three markets you think about. You think about vacation rentals like Airbnb, because it's easy, because it's all chat, right? So just put a chat button and save yourself time. Real estate, because of the hotness of the market and the high ticket clients that there are there. And number three was social media marketing agencies. So everybody in the AA first flocked to those industries. And we're here at this live event talking to actual people. Gen Xers, to be fair, but talking to actual people. And they think they're first, dude. They think they're first. They're excited that they're the first ones to discover this, bro. It's so fucking crazy. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is how well positioned we are that they think that they're first and that we created this technology is what they think. How do you know so much about it if nobody knows? It's been a year and a half, dude. You're not first. But what an awesome opportunity to guide someone through the first steps. First and so much more sellable. On that note, and if anybody, any ideas come to mind, please interrupt me. On that note, since we're in marketing, I want to talk about marketing. We're going to simplify. We're going to simplify. We're going to focus on two things in marketing. Short video content and fake MVP. Short video content is grabbing everything we have so far and chunking it down. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRe record some of our demos that make it so we can do 30 42nd shorts that very quickly go through the ski chalet concierge that has three different utilities. It can make up a day for skiing for you. It can plan your day for this specific chalet. There are specific services. Number one, that's one video. Number two, it can look up which ski lifts are open for whichever mountain you ask. That's number 230, 40 seconds. And then there's number three, which is find restaurants near me. And suddenly you have three videos out of one product that are very easily consumable and that go straight to the point. 10 seconds. Who we are at faster ICE. 20, 30 seconds. We came up with this very interesting utility for vacation rentals. Bang. Done. Scheduler assistant. Hey, how many employees do you manage? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHow much time do your people spend scheduling those people? Oh, well, we created this for a company managing 200 employees for twelve different tasks. And our solution creates your schedule in a few seconds. Here it is. But it can also put time off. And that's a different video. And redo the schedule when somebody'sick. Bam. Two video series, 40 seconds each. And that's another one of our products. And we have content on content. On content, dude, so short video content, I think that just speaks for itself. But we don't only have two projects and those are ones that are done if we're talking building in public. This is unlimited amount of content. Okay, I think I've made up my point. And then fake MVP, part of what I'd also like to use LinkedIn dollars for, which is within an industry. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd we've been talking a lot about real estate and we already have the in on real estate and we disproved what was my main concern, which was. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou said you have the recordings of that talk. You did. You could chop that up and throw on short video. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBang, another one. Yes, exactly. So live event, product building, public tutorial. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nMaybe GPT tutorial or something? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, absolutely. We have PFA, we have a lot, and there's no type of video that's easier to make than short video content. And now we have tools that can create the edit, create, subtitle everything for us. So huge fake MVP within the real estate industry, what resonates most? That's what we're going to go test and we can go ask people and all that stuff. But how do we do it at scale? And I think this is a really good way to do that. Maybe it's simply like for our live event, we create sort of, hey, this is what we have built. If you want to see what else you can build for your real estate agency, come to the slide event. And it's the same ad three times showing three different products. The scheduler for appointments. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhen we create one, the concierge and the whatever. And lead qualifier is the other one that we want to revamp, which we also heard yesterday. Hey, if I could just get some kind of lead qualifier. So fake MVP, that's that for marketing. We're going to forget about blog posts for now. We're going to forget about anything that's time intensive. We're going to forget about posting schedule other than for short video content, because right now the manpower that we have is solid, but it's not large. So let's focus on what is most effective right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAlejo, quick question, and this might be a silly question. Do you have a fasterize email? Alejo p one at fasterize. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, you do. That's alejo@fasterize.com. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nPerfect. I just want to use that for when we reach out to Roberto, who is also in property management, because his biggest pain point is following up with clients in the beginning of sales process, which is exactly what we're talking about. So I want that email to come from faster eyes and we can talk about that and send it later. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSounds good. Awesome. Awesome. So let's also take the outreach time to do that. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, definitely. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo, Zach, I need your headshot. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYes, sir. I'm actually doing a new one for LinkedIn anyway, so Keanu will have that soon. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAwesome. And for current projects to get you guys up to date, we have the zoom transcriber to pine cone. I'm going to get a better name for this. Pine cone is where we store data. And it's not a normal database. It's a database that contains a bunch of numbers that represent the text. So in a normal database, you have, hey, you posted this post on LinkedIn, and this is the post that you posted. And that's how you would save it. In a vector database, it's just numbers. How do you do it? So for knowledge basis to work, this feeds directly into this. A knowledge base works with those numbers, with those representations of the words, because computers understand numbers, not words. So some really smart people said, hey, what if we can create a mapping a. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis word is this number, and this word is that number, and this paragraph is this series of numbers. That's how a knowledge base works. And then you do math on top of it and it works. It's wonderful. It's wonderful because we don't have to build it ourselves, but we are going to build the application. So that's what's so cool about it. And this is why the knowledge base builder is our core priority for the coming weeks, months, however long it takes to build and test it. And our first client is ourselves. This call right now is great food for what were planning on doing in an hour, which was recording the story of faster eyes and what we do, what projects we're working on. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis call right now is actually what were planning to do in an hour, which is, hey, where are we at? What have been our past projects? What are we currently working on, and what's our strategy moving forward with that knowledge for the next outreach call, for example, we can start asking questions to the knowledge base like, hey, I have this idea and that idea. How does that fit our current strategy, and how can I make it put it in practice? So very exciting. And then the massive outreach system, which is very exciting. Our initial prototypes have shown a lot of promise in taking somebody's LinkedIn, gathering all the information and the recent posts, and outputting a very natural sounding email. Yeah, and. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-02-22 GenExec Meeting - Overview of products, teams, objectivescleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 4\\nI meant to move all my site packages to the wrong thing. I meant to move like one thing and I moved the whole site package directory to the wrong thing. I had to reinstall everything.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat sucks. Wait, you moved it like you don't.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nKnow where or like I know where. I moved it all into a text file with a JSON text file. I was trying to do something the other way around. I just messed it up. But now I've fixed it. Have you ever used the Kaggle API?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, so I'll share my screen because I'm kind of stuck right now. I've fixed it, but now I'm at the point where it should work and it's not working. But I fixed my previous errors. Can you give me share screen?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThere we go.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI just got one off Kaggle. So which screen am I sharing?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou're sharing Jupyter notebooks right now?\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYes. So the way you do it is I'm going to have to add more sharing options. That should be enough.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCan you see the terminal?\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo I've moved into the Kaggle JSON because basically the Kaggle file just looks like this. It's just got username, the API key. And you got to move it into a certain directory and then you're meant to be able to haggle datasets download and then just the dataset name. But now it's saying it's missing username and configuration. But I know it's not because I just checked.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, yeah. No, it is looking in the right folder and I know that because I've had other errors where it wasn't looking in the right folder and it said move it into the right folder.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat if we go to that location on your computer?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCopy that? You copy the users all the way up to the, and now go to terminal and go CD and now paste and we're going to remove the last py file. We're just going to go into the directory.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, so that's funny. We're going to say sudo.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOh yeah, I've done that. And then.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou put your computer password.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I did.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo you have to do pseudocd. There we go. Move the pY.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWhat does Pseudo do?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's like your admin access. So you can access everything in the computer. Which is dangerous because you can also remove everything in the computer. Do ls weird. Strange.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDo pseudo. Yeah. Okay. And now go CD to that folder.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNow go lf. Yes. Okay, so load config is not in there. Oh, wait, load config is supposed to be in that kaggle API extended. So why don't you go nano? The command is called nano. You can use vim, too. But anyway, Kaggle API extended and tab completion should work, by the way. Okay, and now press enter. And if you go be. If you go down with your arrow keys. We're looking for load config. Keep going down.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, we will calculate PI copy name username key. Yes. Config file. It has to be different than that. Is that what the name was?\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, Kaggle Json inside of the.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd the directory is called Kaggle config. Well, we pasted the directory from the error.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, you know what we're going to do? We're going to pause this now and make sure we get the right config directory later.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's see. Did you get around to testing the new prompt?\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, I did, but I'm almost done with the icebreaker. I tested the prompt for the icebreaker and it did really well.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCould you show us?\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSure. Give me a minute.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAre you guys actively using upwork or?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNot actively. How come?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI found some kind of automation to basically automate finding jobs through some feed like RSS, something like that, and making the proposals automatic. I think we could set this mean. I'm going hard on upwork now because we got the first client for celebrities, basically, like the most promising now through upwork. First it was just a little project, but then I make an upsell for something way bigger. I'm just busy making an offer for that, but for here, for pastorized, and for the whole future with me, with AI. And I guess you also maybe want to join this initiative to make this upwork. I'm visualizing it like a group initiative where we build the system, automate the stuff, and then we would also build something on top that would delegate those upwork jobs to the people that can actually do them. Or maybe like we could match in teams, something like that.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI really like that idea. It feels like only a couple of steps away from what we're doing right now with the emails. Instead of LinkedIn profiles, you just get job descriptions.\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThis is the icebreaker prompt. This is the result here. So I use Yalakun, that's like a chief researcher at Meta. So these are the thought. I was truly impressed by your work on projects like, could you share about your approach to data compression and intelligent data analysis in this project, giving your expertise in AI machinery robotic? I'm curious to know your thoughts on the future of computer vision technology. How do you see it evolving? Recombinate your background. So it brought out like five icebreakers that we could use. So this is the template I refined it to, like we discussed in the last. We discussed that I should remove the templates and I removed it. So I'm giving the AI a chance to generate email drafts by itself. So this is the way it came out. The prompt is not still very effective though, but it is using the icebreakers. The information I give it. I'll need your help with recrafting this email draft.\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo dear Yalakun, I hope this message finds you well. As a professor, researcher, and thought leader in AI, machine learning, deep learning, robotics, your contribution in this field has truly been remarkable. I'm reaching out to you on behalf of Fastrise, an AI-driven chatbot company that focuses on amplifying human potentials through AI automation. Fastrise's mission aligns closely with your expertise, emphasizing efficiency, creativity, and human connection. Our chatbot is designed to assist businesses in understanding how AI can transform their operations, with a specific focus on automation, data analysis, and market optimization.

I look forward to the possibility of working together and leveraging our expertise to drive AI innovation. Thank you for your time. Regards, Your Name, Your Title, FastRise Team.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat is very solid. We'll work on making it sound more human and shorter and less formal, but other than that, it touches on all the points we wanted. There is one thing. Is this using the new knowledge base file?\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nNot yet.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt feels like it is, but yes. Other than that, this is good at saying, hey, I think there's alignment here and here, and I think this is why we can collaborate together. When it comes to cold emails, we're going to have to figure out the clear objective, what our offer really actually is, and how that aligns to who they are and what they do. So that's going to be, I think, a little bit extra prompting to make sure maybe it's always mention one of our products and why it would fit with them. Or maybe it's like, hey, make sure the call to action is very clear because there's not a clear next step that this person can do or follow other than saying partnership sounds great, but partnership of what?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think what you've built so far is great. So Kuba, what did you say to Bartek that you need help with refining?\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. This email prompts, I feel it could be better than this.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou mean this is a new prompt, right?\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, this is like a new prompt. It generates this email. I feel it could be better with help.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCan you say again if the prompt is better when you do it yourself?\\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI used PFA, but with the recent prompts that you refined with the one you sent, the one in your GitHub repo, the output was much better than the prompt I was using before.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, so there's room for improvement. Awesome. Just to make sure you got that. Bartek, the prompt that you shared with us on GitHub is much better and I see what Kuba is saying regarding this prompt. It can be improved in that it's more aligned with our objective. For example, there it acknowledges the recipient's professional background and achievements using information which. Sure, yeah, that makes sense, but how do we tie it into how we can work together and what our actual offer and call to action are? So those are things that can be improved for sure. So if you guys can connect, maybe we go into a breakout room. And if you guys can connect now and work on just like the next version of this prompt, that would be awesome.Speaker 2\\nAnd I'll tell you what we can do. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo, I have idea, because this is the final prompt for making the actual email. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'm thinking we should get sales team to think about the best template we can have. What should the email have? It's the best to give an example. Yeah, let the example be good thinking through by the people who are good at sales. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. I think that's a really good call, dude. We'll come back to you with some improvements of what we want to specify in the prompt. The absolutely necessary things to make sure the prompt flows nicely. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, okay, sounds good. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'll figure out how we go about that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt can be example. There could be template of, say, components, like opening some kind of things. I don't know, there could be maybe hook or something, or hook, twist body, some kind of related stuff. And then later CTA, something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou can give it a framework to follow. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, framework, definitely. That's good. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd to be fair, I know two. It's number one. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhat do you call it? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAlex Ramosis and Nicos. I know those two, and they both seem very effective to me. So I'll come back to you with what we're following. A framework that we're following for the AI to go off of so it doesn't go into too long, like very long sentences and just focuses on. Yeah, sure. Acknowledge the professional background. That's a great idea. Acknowledge achievements and also come back to what is relevant to us. So, like, section that acknowledges professional background and section detailing potential synergy could be one sentence as opposed to two different sections. Okay, cool. I'll look into it and come back to you guys with a framework to use. Kuba, you mentioned the icebreaker. Would you show that to us again? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd the prompts are what? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThese are the prompts. This is the prompt here. So the prompt back. Give. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'm very curious about this one. Do you have the example from before? So we could see where we improving. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo before were just using the icebreakers from an API, that proxy call. Let me just show you. So the icebreaker was. The icebreaker was just here, creating it here. So I just removed it because we had the discussion, me, Ali and Eric, we had a discussion, so decided we should remove the icebreaker, we should make it on its own. So I just removed it and this was the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo Bartek is asking what were the results when were trying it before? So maybe in the version history of the notebook we could check what that looked like before, because he's trying to compare outputs, essentially he's trying to compare what improvement is thereafter. PFA gets run on the prompt. So I'm sure you can share the notebook with him later and he can check those out. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, sure, I'll show it to him. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'd like to try one thing, which is putting all of this now that we have some better clarity, in a way, I'd like to put the knowledge base in there and maybe it's used as a tool. I don't see how there's a different way to use the knowledge base because it is a couple of pages of words, right? Using it as a knowledge base that gets access at every prompt, if that is feasible, using it as a system prompt. Either way it's going to consume a lot of tokens and that's fine because we need to test now, what does it look like? On the best possibility, this was good for 3.5. This was good for 3.5. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is where we wanted to get to somewhere we're like, we're not going to use this simply because somebody's going to read this and know that it was maybe computer generated, but on GPT four latest model, what would that look like? So can we modify all of the LLms to use GPT four? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, sure. And yes, the knowledge base is going to better creating it too, for it. I was thinking about it earlier and thank God you brought it up. So creating a tool for our knowledge base is going to better. And yes, I just need to tweak it to using GPT four. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSounds good. Yeah, GPT four turbo. And we'll get the best quality output we can. We'll also look at it against cost, but once we have some good example outputs, then we can step forward and say, hey, here are some good examples to follow. Here's the framework, here are some good examples to follow. And then we can call it and we'll have that because we have the contacts that we want to email, we have the industry that we want to do, which is real estate. So let's finish a solid base model using GPT four and integrating the knowledge base. We'll modify the prompts a bit. I'll get together with people in outreach to make sure that it's in the right direction. So knowledge base, GPT four turbo prompts, Cuba integrated knowledge base and the GBD four turbo. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I'll get on the prompts and then we can have another look at it tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAbout how we can make going to the better outputs more clear, like what we should do and how we should test that later on during the development. And I'm thinking either way we could make some kind of air table to have all the outputs going there, but that might be maybe overdoing. We could just have it actually sending a mail to some dummy email box and let's have all outputs in one place so we can compare them later. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nInteresting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat would be the easiest way to do that? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nProbably comprehensive way where we could have AP call to airtable, let's say, and have every little output from here, like nitty gritty details of every agent output could be parsed to airtable and we could have good look at it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat would be the best way of choosing the best outputs once again. Oh yeah. No, I think you're right. And that would be the best way to choose the best outputs. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. And if we make it like this inner table, every agent separately, we can also see where things are breaking if something goes wrong. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, okay, sounds good. Henry, could you set up an air table base? Okay, yeah. You're back. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I just got back. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIf you could quickly set up an air table base, we're going to keep the emails that we draft in there to be able to compare the quality of the different prompts and outputs. That'd be awesome. Other than that, we're talking about, let's write some stuff down. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. We're talking GPT four. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe'Re talking. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nKnowledge base. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then we're talking, you should have. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAccess to it as well. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCould you share the link? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou can just go into faster. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe're not paying, still paying thousands for airtable, are we? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNo. Okay, good. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI think we might be still using credits. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat's the name of this base? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFasterized dev team. If you go to workspaces, be on the left. Workspace settings, fasterized dev team. And then. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nHey guys, how are you doing? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHey, Jorg, how's it going, man? \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nDoing great and good. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nGood. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's good to see you here, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, back. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nThank you. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nWhat are you doing, Henry? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI can't see it. If you can, it's not like showing up for me. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nShould I have screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. 1 second orga. There's a couple of things I want to. If you go to the. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nUntitled base. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, okay, got you. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nJust name it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSomething we'll go with that. We can do. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nKind of like prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nDate agent, something like that. And we'll go from there. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nEmail copy email. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think we should get a reasoning maybe not all now, but like for later you can just note it down. Not all connecting immediately, just emails, but later we should get also reasoning and maybe the icebreakers. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo kind of like. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think prompt and agent will be the same thing basically. So you can just use one. We know which prompt would go to which agent, I guess. Or maybe actually so I will. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHere. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBartek, what's your email? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBartek Tomashevsky. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet me get this wrong. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAfter s is that s? Yeah. W key w ski. That's correct@celebrities.com. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd I have also one thing I wanted to say. I'm thinking to introduce one of the juniors from silver to this project if you guys want to have more people on board. And I'm thinking if he could join the fast rides like be the deaf here, that's okay because I'm not having much time to actually train my junior and he is just waiting for a project currently. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell yeah, let's meet him maybe on Wednesday's dev meeting. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes, actually he have time on Wednesday so I will arrange that. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd one more thing. I'm throwing the upwork automation in the chat so you guys can check it out later. We can inspire from it and maybe make something more than this guy make. Just make something on make. I think we can connect it with this identity system we got here. But this make automation will be for getting the jobs that match our criteria and then we will send those jobs to this agent system to write the proposal, let's say. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, yeah, that's fantastic. Okay. This is great because this is what I was hoping for. The knowledge base about who we are is the same and it's great. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'm actually using knowledge base from my upwork profile to write the proposals currently. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's great. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'm just saying like load bio knowledge base and then make proposal for this job offer. And I'm just pasting the text currently, but we can definitely get that automated. And I think that the most tedious thing is looking at those upwork jobs as they appear and you got to be fast. You better be in the first hour there with your proposal. So I think that's best thing to automate because for me it's tiring to even look like scrolling. 1 hour these jobs. I don't know how much you're trying to get there. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I hear you. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, sounds good. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, that's cool. There is another thing, Bartek, which is the knowledge based system. I'd like to dig into the ideas you had with Powell around what that system might look like for you guys. What the initial thoughts you had around sort of living breathing knowledge base. And I talked obviously about the zoom to transcript automation system and how do we level that up. And I feel like your skills will be greatly put to use in that project. So let's reconnect maybe later today and talk more about that. So I want to see where your headset and how you visualize it and how we match visions with this. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThere's definitely some ideas for that. I wasn't really talking about this with Pavo. Like we don't figure out how we want to make our knowledge base for celebrities, more of coming up with ideas, how we could use that rather than how we're going to make it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, it's easier. It's easier to come up with ideas of what you wish you had than actually doing foundation. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut definitely I've been also thinking about, I don't want to just make storm of ideas in here like too much because if there's too much ideas at one meeting then there is not going to be executed next time. But as you're asking about this, I've been thinking about making together GPTs that would be making the knowledge base structure. So that would be like a proof of concept for maybe average prompt or agent or whatever that we could add to this knowledge base transcript system. And it would not only get the transcript into the knowledge base, but also it would make a structure like for example markdown or something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nProbably increase readability on the other side for sure. That's one thing regarding the meeting. I cannot make it today, maybe tomorrow or after, whatever. I'm just changing my schedule so I'll be about 1 hour because I've been the night person so much now. I'm changing the sleep schedule. Sabbath more available in the morning hours now. And hopefully working like a normal person, not only in the night. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, sounds good brother. I used a series of GPTs to create this and then I printed it, which is the knowledge base and it reads kind of nicely there's still work to be done, but very happy with the current results, has all our tools, what we've worked on, what we want to work on, our types of the industries that we want to tackle, et cetera. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNice. Can you send me a file so I'll check it out tomorrow? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, I will tag you on the post on discord. And what else? Oh, yeah. Kuba, would you share one more time the Google Colab so we can show Yorg? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay. All right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo we've been working on a very interesting system for automating outreach. And in this system we want to leverage a few things. Number one, obviously the incredible abilities of GBD. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nFour. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNumber two, prompt engineering, particularly Bartex PFA for creating elaborate prompts from a simple one. And you'll see some examples of that. Number three, our targets LinkedIn profiles and recent posts, et cetera. So their LinkedIn profile. Number four, a sequence of agents which will, as Kuba is about to show you, which will take the information for the profile, find the things that are useful, create an email, and then critique that email to do a final version of the email. What useful means is always relative to who we are and who we want to target, what we are selling. So the fifth sort of utility tool that we have is a knowledge base that we created last week about faster ICE. So we're going to be leveraging all those things, create these emails to start sending mass emails to. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd your help is going to be huge for identifying good emails from bad emails and figuring out what framework are we going to use for these emails. So it's going to be very much a human machine, human kind of project. If you can, go ahead. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, I'm sharing my screen now. Can I see? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo this is the first prompt for extracting from the LinkedIn profile. Okay. Yeah, you should answer only. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSorry, guys, because I need to go soon. I don't want to stop you if you want to go over this holding now, but I'm going to have to do like five more minutes. We can just jump into the PFA and try to upgrade this prompt live. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou know what? Let's do this. I'll send you the link and if you can start looking at it, Bartek, that'd be great. So York can see this and then we can all pitch into with ideas. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, so I'll just run it in the PFA and I will probably share you the chat because I will have to bounce in like eight minutes. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYep, yep, sounds good. I'm sharing the link to the colab on the chat, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, yeah, go ahead, Rukuba. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSorry about the noise. So first of all, this class is to extract the LinkedIn URL of the client from a Google search. So this is the tool I created for the agent to use. So this is like initializing the agent. So this is the prompts for the agent, and the prompt says, your answer should contain a profile URL link. I give it the two and I give it the format. This is also for initializing the agent. So when I input the name of the person, like the name of the client I'm looking for, this is the chief scientist about meta. So you search Google and only extracts the LinkedIn URL of your lacoun. So using LinkedIn URL, I run it through proxy call to script and cruise data off LinkedIn. And this is the result here that. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nWorks for anyone or just for many people that are well known. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo what did you say? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, that should work for anyone. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nJust anyone? Yes. So this is the result of Yalakunda script using proxy core. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nYeah, that sounds awesome. Honestly, it could save so much time. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo this is just like formatting based on the information I extracted. I'm calling a class. This is an output password to format Yalaku's full name introduction about. I'm using GPT to know format the information I got into. Full name of Yalakun introduction about him, project, his experience and topic of interest based on the information I script on LinkedIn. Then this is the prompt for it. And this is the output that I brought back. Then from this is the next page, which is like loading pastorized knowledge into event. So this is another two I created. So these two is just like based on the information I script about Yalakun. Now I'm going to qualify if Yalakun is qualified to work with fast price. This is what the agent is doing. So this is the prompt of the agent based on the information. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCan we look at that prompt real quick? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay, so this is it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nRate. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is for lead qualification. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nRelevant analysts matchmaker with deep understanding of artificial intelligence and AI sector. So based on the industry we are going to work on, so we refine the prompt. So for qualifying the lead must be relevant to the industry we're working with. Do you understand? If we're working with the ski shell industry, we can just refine our prompt to really accept clients that are related to ski shell industry. But for now, because I just did like an AI sector. Do you understand? \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nYeah, I do understand. It's pretty complicated, but it just seems really good. Can actually help us on the outreach. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo this is the final answer. Yalakun is highly significant individual in the AI sector. Will be a valuable asset to our company in advancing our solutions. So this is just like qualifying the lead. So this prompt is just like for summarizing our password node. Bees. So this next one is just like for the icebreaker. Based on information I have about Kun, I need to create an icebreaker. This is the prompt for jazz breaker. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo those icebreakers are essentially going to be the first line of the email, and we're going to write the rest of the email based on these icebreakers. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nOne approach, basically, it writes an email automatically depending on the information about him. Is that right? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd the information about us? \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nYeah, of course. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThese two is just like, to draft the email. So this is the prompts for drafting the email. You're a copywriter. Your role is to craft engaging and personalized and email like outro email that aligns with both a recipient profile information and our company's objective. That's fast, right? To start the introduction of email and information we have about our company development. So this is just like, I'm just giving it information I have about Yala Kon, then password. And I'm telling you to craft out the email. So this was the result. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTake a second York to read that and you'll have your criticism. But that's the first draft of the email it's written. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nHow can I create. So this was created with this code, right? This email, correct? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWith everything you saw so far? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nSo I always. I personally think that wouldn't work, even though it's actually great, the concept and all that, it's actually great. What I would do with this tool, in my opinion, what I would do is I just gather the information and then craft the email myself, or just with a sort of structured template email to create the email. Because here, as you know, for me, I know that this is pretty much AI generated and not many people will like to receive this kind of email. So what I would do is to simplify all this and just have sort of a structure of the email where then you can then add this human touch yourself. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo what I'm thinking now is we could do few short prompting. If you can craft out templates that we can use, like two or three, and we can train the AI on human templates for you to follow. So to understand, okay, this is how I'm supposed to talk. This is how I'm supposed to drop out the email. Do you understand? I think it will bring out better output. Sorry. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think we're on the same page regarding, number one, the quality, how effective this email would be, which is not very effective in obviously getting answer right. I think you run to something with needing structure, needing a structure to follow. What would that structure be? So what we're thinking is, let's start with the overarching. Let's start with the framework. And which framework would we want to use? Whose framework would we want to use for the structure of the. And the two that come to mind. The only two that come to mind are Alex Formosi or NicOs. Very simple, straightforward, understandable. This is the framework of the email. And after we can get a few. We're going to do some improvements to this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd after we can get a few emails that you and I say, hey, these actually are definitely going in the right direction, or these icebreakers work really well, or we create our own. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThen. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe can go back to the step and say, hey, here's the framework we use, and here are some examples of the email and why they're effective. From that we can say, hey, write the whole email without the icebreaker, and we make the icebreaker write the whole email, but I'll write the call to action. And we write the call to action from there. We have a lot more flexibility. We can do it however we want to do it. And I very much think like it's opportunity to go parallel on human and parallel on fully generated. For now, we need to come up with two things. Number one, the framework that we want to use, and we want to guide the GPT to follow. So what's the framework for writing the email? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd number two, looking into what are all the, say, critical factors, what really are we offering? Is the question here, what is our offer? Why are we sending this email? And we need to make that crystal clear. It might be that we are sort of initially talking about a consultation to find out how they could use it, or it might be more straightforward. It's like, hey, we built this system. We built an outreach system. We built automated listing finder for real estate agents that sends SMS automatically. Whatever that product is. How do we mix it into the email? So let's take some time to figure that out. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nSo you want the structure, let's. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet devs go do their thing and continue working on their stuff. And let's stay here, you and I, and we can look into it. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nYeah, but for the email campaign, I think we should launch it as soon as possible. When do you think, could we do that? Because you have the emails ready and all that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. Well, we can do that right now. I don't see why not. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nI think for me that's more important because we have to start to keep outreaching and trying to get clients rather than trying new outreach methods. Because this one, we said we're going to do it, but we actually didn't yet, and we don't know if it works or not. So the thing here, we just have to test out and see how that works out. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, absolutely. So let's set up the email campaign right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nOkay, perfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nKuba Bartek. Henry, what clarity or questions do you have? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI don't have any questions about this project, but I do want to finish up what were doing at the start of the call. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCan you guys look into the promise factory channel on Discord? Yeah, I could see that draft of the framework. It could look something like this. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI like that format. And we will tweak it a little bit. Could you copy paste the. Oh, you copied chat? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think that's very straightforward. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo that's cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAlso, the whole prompt is on the repo because it's kind of got. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOut. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOf context of the answer of the code window in PFA. So you can get it from the repo. I just copied it in a correct manner because if the output is too long, it just goes out of the code box. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCool. 1 second I'm reading this. Okay, let's do this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nJorg, could you please pull up a framework that you have been using or feel comfortable about using anything that you can walk me through quickly so we align on what framework we want to use for the writing the emails. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nDidn't we create the framework when were making the emails on the note? Let me see if I can find it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I got to go check out the upwork thing. Let's talk Wednesday about that and keep it posted on the table so I could maybe help how to set up the headers of testing so we could only go over the code again tomorrow in the morning of this whole system, and I will note down some things that we should consider taking out of there into their table for proper testing. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, good call. And let's connect, you and I, tomorrow to talk about the knowledge base, about the builder. Knowledge base builder. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYep, definitely shoot me your hours and I will choose. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCool, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSee ya, guys. See ya. Henry, you want to share screen real quick and sort that config stuff out. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nAll right, guys, I'll check. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. So changing to GBD for turbo and knowledge base, those are priorities. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nAll right, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAwesome. Thank you, Guba. Great work, brother. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nBye, guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSee ya. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, so we go back to terminal. Okay, awesome. So we're looking at, it says, os environment. Get Kaggle config directory. When you're in here, you're going to need to use the arrow keys, looking. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAll the way down again. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, that's good because that has where it's looking for the file versus where it should be. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLooking for the file. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nUp a little bit. See where it says config directory? Config there. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOh, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd config file, that's where it's looking. So we can't find anything. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd now it's saying config values, warning, make directories, span user. And then it's looking for Kaggle. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd can you show me where you wrote where you created that directory? Because you created a directory that was called period Kaggle. You created a directory that was called Kaggle somewhere. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMaybe it's in the terminal, maybe it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWas in the Jupiter notebook. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nKaggle API. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then go up more. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, so not there. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGo to your terminal and scroll up. Yeah. Okay. At the very beginning, make directory. Squigglyline Kaggle. At the very top. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI moved it to this directory. That's not make, that's move, but right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOn top of that, you made it. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOh, that's make, I had no idea what that was. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, yeah, that's make directory. And then you change the permission access to 600. That was on purpose. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is what we're going to do. Scroll down and we're going to say. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWithin that, within that kaggle Json, you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSee where it says Os environment, os path join. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOh, yeah, I see that. Yeah, OS environment. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, before that it says or something else. So with the arrow keys, you're going to go to that point and delete it. Delete that first part before Os path. Yes, we're going to delete all of that. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo I'm deleting the right thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nJust keep going. Okay, cool. And now we are going to save this. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBy saying control o. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOr command O. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nControl o. Maybe it's okay, cancel it's function. Control o. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI've got a weird. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh shit, I deleted it. Yeah, just do an equal. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, but I can't type it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat's funny. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, I'm just going to take control of your computer for a second. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. You realize you could probably delete everything yeah, I know. This is ultimate trial. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNot today. Not today. File name, right? Yes. And now we go. And now we go. This might not work yet. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nMissing username. Yeah, it's the same error. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhere is control? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nW where is. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLoad? Big. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThere we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo load config, but give me the next one. Self load config. Where are you? Where are you? Okay, let's see. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLoad config, final step of the authenticate steps where we load the values from config data into the configuration object. Config data dictionary with configuration values. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nKeys to read into self config values. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nUsername and password require config name user config name key. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhere do these come from then? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nConfig name user and config name key are the two items in the jSon. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut when are these being loaded? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLet's see. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's the API extended. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI'm kind of surprised that it even goes to this folder because I thought the directory was just something. Not API, kaggle, something. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhoa. Okay. Select self it config value. Self config name. Where the fuck are you, man? Self config name user. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou're still taking control of my screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. Cool. Okay, that's fine because I can do like this. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nDid you do a lot of this kind of stuff at Nike or not? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh God, no. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I'm so glad I didn't. Where are you that, okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nReconfig file. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSince we can get the username. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd password from the environment. How? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's the second method where you save it to the environment. There's two methods. You can do it. You can either do it where you have it in the environment and you go, here's the username and password, and you export it and save it in the environment, or you use the API or you use the json file. Does that make this extend? Maybe this whole API extended is the extended version. So the second version where you're using it in the environment. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, that would make sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat would certainly make sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut something not really. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI don't get how we're in this file because if you go to the very top. No, you can just scroll up. You don't need to do the arrows like up here. What did I do? Yeah, when I moved the file, I just moved it to Kaggle, Kaggle jSon. I didn't even mention this API extended until later. I don't know. Does that make sense? Like, I'm looking at this line here. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, right. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, let me try something. If I go X and I go nano and if this doesn't work, then I'm going to step away and I'll let you play with Chaijibit. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is empty. No, wait, I messed up. Well, this should be where you're doing it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I opened in a text file earlier and it worked. That would make sense if it's empty. If you go nano and then let's type in there, I can give you the exact stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, let's do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBecause from 3 hours ago, this was it. There you go. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo weird. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt's empty. I don't know how it's become empty. I originally thought, okay, it must be empty then. So then I opened the file in text editor and it said the same stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nFile name to write. Open file for writing. What the fuck does that mean? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI could redownload the file and we could start from the get go. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, we don't really need to do that. We can say, hey, echo. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNo, not that. We don't need to do that. We can say, hey, one sec, echo this into here. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, it's a directory. How the fuck does that work? What do you mean? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo strange. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt's there, but it's meant to be in this list, isn't it? Right? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWait, give me a second. Okay. I know, lsaot. I know. Why is this a directory? That's so weird. How is this a directory? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI may have done something, I don't know. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, that's fucking funny. Wait, no, because just a file. No, we're like super close to fix this. This is a directory so I can remove there. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd remove. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh my God, how does this even work? Whoa, what happened? Oh, this is where you moved everything. Oh my God, we figured it out. That's so funny. Oh my God, that's so funny. So we're going to go back. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAlso, can you do me a favor? I didn't know how to get to, I wanted to remove everything from this file because when I was speaking to Chad GPT, it was so funny, my conversation with Chad GPT. In fact, let me show you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI don't have time because waiting. I don't want to make him wait anymore. But I'm going to let you, director, I'm going to let you. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMove this to this, right? This is how you do it. You move one thing, you move it to that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd now directories is where you have all of these. Now I'm going to create a file. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThere we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNow I'm going to create a file called Kaggle JSon with that information in. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBecause if they're put back, they can be. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry. Say that again. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou know all the Jupyter notebook, the WGet, all those stuff in the terminal? Yeah, I want to delete it because I had to reinstall and chat. GPT was like, because I sent everything there. It's very risky and I'll probably get errors if I just move it right back. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, that sounds about right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOr is that all just X? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, you'd want to do it the right way. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou need quotes around username. Thank you. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I thought there was something off here. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSingle quote. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt'S the same, right? Oh, I can just copy that. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNever mind, because I tried doing it the other way and it didn't quite work. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I need. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nDemo rag. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou shut the fuck up. Oh my God. Let's go. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's weird. Can you do CMOd 600? I think you need to redo that again. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhy? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBecause look, your kaggle API key is readable by other users on the system. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, you're fine, but sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAlso, what do I do about, I was kind of lost when I was following you when all those files showed up. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo it kept saying, you can't do this because Kaggle JSon is a directory. I'm like, what the fuck do you mean it ends in a JSOn? Well, directories apparently don't have very weird naming conventions, so you can put an extension on a directory. So what happened? I realized Kaggle JSon is the directory. I tried reading into the directory and all of this showed up. So I kept trying to save a file with words in it and it's like, no, you can't, this is a directory. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I see. Have we deleted this directory? And I'll have to piv install everything again. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe renamed it to directories. I'm going to actually do you a favor and move all of this into old directories and you're going to have a copy of everything. You're going to have that in your base directory. So if you go home, which is. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThis is how you do it now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou'Ll be able to see old directories in there somewhere. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOld directories, home. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI do. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLs for home. You do this, you do CD, squiggly line. Squiggly line. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, how do I get to root at Henry's MacBook air? Because that's something that was also interesting that you did. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, you get here proper root. You go CD and then again CD, and now you're in root. This is the shit you don't want to mess with. This is the shit you usually can't mess with unless you're in. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLike if I made a new terminal now, it doesn't start with root at Henry's MacBook fair. It starts with like Henry Allen at mail. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYep. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause you go CD squiggly line. Right. Because went into super user. Remember we said pseudo s and that gives you like admin power in your own computer. And now it changed to root. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, got it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I'm glad it works. I hope it doesn't get stuck soon. And good luck with the rag. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI've been working on that sort of lesson thing whilst I've got my screen on. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, we're going to need it for proper pull out. For proper pull out? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. These images are my favorite. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI love that. Did you check out that resource I shared for. Oh yeah, you should definitely check that out. There's gold in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I'll check it out again. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, this one. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAll right. I'll let you help york out then. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAll right, see you, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nPeace. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm going to send you a link and. Oh, I sent it already. If you jump on there, we can go over the prompts together. Or actually let's start the other way around. Let's start with me sharing screen. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd we're going to go over some of these. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSome of the points because you had something to share is simply looking at what is the framework that we want to follow and give guidance on what. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nThat framework is and keeping it. We are first going to do the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, that's right. Let's finish the campaign. Sorry about that. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nYeah, okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, you're right. So campaigns that we started were this, you can call it a failure, whatever you want. There were no replies. The open rate wasn't bad. Started around 50 something. Anyway. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nSo you sent it already. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThese are. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nI can see you have to change. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou can't see my screen. Got you. So this is an old campaign that we had done because we needed to start and was a bit of a test campaign. So I thought we had sent 300, I think. Yeah, we had sent 300. A bunch bounced. It wasn't a grade list. It wasn't supposed really to make any sales. It was more for us to be. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAble to. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nStart getting used to instantly. I think I showed you these, I showed you the sequences that we did and. Yeah, that's about it. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nOkay. Didn't we go over it last time? I think went over it, yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe did go over it last night. Last time. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nSo we just have to set up everything. We are ready. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Do you want to do it as a follow up? Do you want to do it as a different campaign with same email list? Or do you want to do different email lists altogether? \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nWait, I don't understand. What do you mean? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo there are 300 contacts here, right? Nobody really responded. So you said you had emails ready? \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo do you want to do it as a follow up to these emails? \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nOkay. It depends on how good quality do you think those prospects are? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nVery bad. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nThen here's my answer. I don't think for purpose of trying to get a client. Why should we be mediocre? Let's go for the best ones because. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOf the purpose of time. So how much time do we have in finding those email? So I have some shortcuts that we can do to get a new email list. Your emails are for vacation rentals? Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nMainly. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, let's sort this out. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWould you walk me through some of the emails? \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nOkay, let me see. It's been a long time. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThey're the ones you shared on discord. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nSo there's the first one. Wait 2 seconds. So as we know, we need the hook. The headline. The headline is I can't believe I'm doing this. Or you can have some variations like I can't believe I'm doing this for you for name something that catches your attention. I don't know. For me that's something that would catch my attention and I would click. But of course we must AP test and have different subject lines. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI agree. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nDo you have the email before you or do you want me to share my screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCould you share screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nYeah, sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nHere. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nCan you see? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, perfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nSo yeah, the headline, as I said, I can't believe I'm doing this. Another one was something like, okay, I have it on my email. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou could copy paste this into a new instantly campaign. So if you want to do like a final edit or something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat works for me. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nWait, is it already on the instantly? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThese emails are not, but they're extremely easy to add. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nIf you want me to add them myself. Whatever you want. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'd love for you to take full charge of the following email campaigns. I think you're totally ready to sort of lead the charge. I'll help you with getting the leads that you need, but sequences, subsequences, scheduling, all that stuff. I want to see you shine, brother. So I'm giving you full control. If you want advice, obviously I'm here so I'm listening. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nOkay, perfect. So the other one that I told you. Is this one. Would you believe this name? It's more personalized, but of course, we can have many different headlines and we should test which ones. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Anyway, I agree. \\n\\nSpeaker 7\\nYeah. So into the core of the email. So, hey, name. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-02-26 Dev Meeting - Update Massive Outreachcleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content='Speaker 2\\nSo then I make a hook by creating sort of interest, to make them keep reading. I talk to them directly by saying, I thought I\\'d turn this by you because it\\'s a pretty ridiculous proposal I think he\\'ll be interested in. So just these two sentences, let them know that it\\'s something that he should keep reading because there\\'s some value in the email. And in my opinion, that\\'s a pretty different approach than most people that go, hey, I work in x company. And so then after the hook, I go and talk about him, the company, and then I explain directly and precisely why am I messaging him. We could help you manage his pain point, which in this case we decided of managing the daily messages they get. And then the offer, is of course a free value. I just say we wanted you to help you for free, for your business, to save you both time and money. Using words, even though this is not the most formal way of writing, I think this could work to create this human touch.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. I hear the intent. Definitely agree with the intent. I think that these are very testable. I think you\\'re onto something.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat\\'s almost it. As I said, I\\'m giving him free value that he could use to grow his business. And that\\'s the goal here, to make him interested with no risk, because it\\'s free. And then I explain how. So I analyze your sales funnel data and craft a strategy to save you both time and money. And then just a quick CTA. I used the negation, where I say, would you be against? Meaning that if he wants to work with us, he has to say no. In psychology, people like to say no. They feel a sense of empowerment.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNegation is definitely a word you could use.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then the follow-ups are normal, not too detailed as the first one. There\\'s not many structures, just overall having different approaches for the follow-up. The main goal here is to see how well the email performs and then how the follow-ups will help that performance.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. Awesome. So let\\'s try to log into the campaign.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt should be okay sending it to you. I\\'ve been thinking a lot about what you said a while ago about all of us should be taking part in outreach. And I agree. I want to find the right timing for getting developers involved in outreach. It\\'s warm outreach, developers reaching out to people they know being like, we build something awesome that you need to see.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, everyone should contribute to outreach because nobody likes outreach and it\\'s nobody\\'s role to only do that. I personally do not like to call outreach especially, but I\\'m just doing it for everyone for the success of the business.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, that\\'s where we\\'re at. We\\'re doing what we need to do for the success. So what kind of outreach do you enjoy doing?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt\\'s still called outreach, but it\\'s just on Instagram. I prefer it, especially to fitness coaches.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, there are quite a few opportunities for Instagram outreach in the real estate space, which we\\'re stepping into.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I\\'m definitely going to start outreach again.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I\\'ll get you the leads in there. Explore those tabs under options. You\\'ll see a bunch. Take your time to explore them.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd for the user\\'s name, how does that work?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt does work. You can look at my previous campaign and see how it\\'s formatted.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, and how much does it cost per campaign?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt\\'s unlimited campaigns. It\\'s just $97 a month for everything. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDo you have any other headlines to test out?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe simplest one ever, \"Let\\'s connect and first name.\" \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, thank you. Let\\'s connect, so we have three different subject lines. That\\'s good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, let\\'s stick with three and we can actually evaluate.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo, what name should we use? Because we are having this Persona where basically we\\'re talking as I.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI used Alex.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, Alex, it\\'s fine.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, you can definitely change the time. Let me try to find it.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDo you know where most people are located?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt\\'s going to be in the US.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. All right. I\\'m done.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Work. Come on. I believe in you.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCan I get 1000?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet\\'s go.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMore than that.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe are going to delete some, for example, that don\\'t have emails.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat\\'s awesome.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nJust far enough leisure, travel, tourism.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCan you send me the link? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSend me the link on here too.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, perfect.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo now we need to identify which work in. We need some that we have actual emails for, otherwise we can\\'t use them. So let\\'s start there. We still have 1000 left though. And now we go back.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, I got everything. Where\\'s the time? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou can definitely change the time.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFrom 09:00 a.m.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll right, schedule.Speaker 1\\nI can just get all of this into one big file. Fucking sick. Facebook. Company. Facebook. Company. Twitter. Hey, are you on Twitter? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, I don\\'t use Twitter. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Is there like line, bio, job line? Okay. We\\'re good. Country. I can get everything into one big file like this. That would be a big win. Oh, is this their expected salary? That\\'s fucking sick, dude. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat? Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat? We have their fucking salaries. That\\'s fucking sick. Oh my God. Okay, cool. Where are we going from here? This is the date gathered. So we have to go verify the emails. It\\'s number one. But in order to do that, we need to be able to get this into one big list. Get this into. Unless this works. If I don\\'t think it\\'s going to. But we can say, hey, Ryun, email verification file. Let\\'s try it. It. Yeah. I wonder what I know I can do is say, hey, if this column has multiple emails. Multiple. If this column called email one has multiple emails, then I need a new one. What I need to do is get to downloads. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat? You want me to download the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, no, sorry. I\\'m just talking out loud like a crazy person. And now I say I just need to get these emails right so you can actually send them. And about 600 of them are valid. And we\\'ll see what those are. We are here and we\\'re saying, hey, there are multiple emails here. Are any of them valid? Are all of them valid? Tenncy 21 ten and C 21. But it didn\\'t check the other one. So that\\'s an issue. So what I need to do is identify. Hey, where are these? More than one. And I need to duplicate the lines. Put the email under that easy. Okay. This might take me a little bit. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, it\\'s okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo I will get these to you. I\\'m going to continue working on these. What I would love for us to have. Okay. For us to have mike. Okay. Look at those emails again in the campaign. So if we can look at those, that\\'d be great. Could you share a screen on your end? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe emails are already on the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I wasn\\'t able to see them on my end. So if we can look at them. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, sure. It\\'s here. Can you see? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo maybe because how are those three the same? Just change the sub. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then just. We\\'ve got the follow ups. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd they are just simple. As we discussed long ago. We have five follow ups I think. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInstantly will only let us do five emails in total. So one and then four follow ups. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou sure? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI\\'m pretty sure. That might be for the old plan. We might need to double check that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut, yeah, it\\'s okay. In that case, you can remove one. We\\'ve got the follow ups. Here\\'s the first one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI\\'m not going to read, though, but if you want, just go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, it\\'s fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen for the days. So I put for the first follow up one day. Pretty simple. Then three days, then seven days. So four day difference. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI don\\'t know if I might do like four or three and six. What do you think? Four is a long. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. I would actually go like 246246 here, but I\\'m not an expert at this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt just makes sense. Don\\'t worry. Me too. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo leave two days between the first and the second message. Okay. Yeah, that works. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen a bit more time for me. Say nine. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSure. Yeah, that works. Cool. And then for times. What were you thinking? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n97 Pacific time. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat\\'s it. Okay, cool. In that case, 09:00 a.m. Pacific is already noon in the east coast. So we would want to start sending from earlier. Right. Six m. And then we shifted. Yeah, that works. So six to four. Six to five. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Okay, awesome. And remember to hit save on everything you change. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd could we go to the first email? There\\'s something I wanted touch on. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet\\'S see. I just thought I\\'d read this by you because pretty ridiculous press I think you\\'ll be interested in. I was looking at and had a few ideas I\\'m confident could help you manage the growing daily messages. So to show confident me and my team are going to give you quick overview of how we could level up your business for free. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMaybe not. I. So it\\'s will analyze because I\\'m saying me and my team. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. So then the offer that we\\'re doing here is essentially a customer service bot. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo should we say, instead of a strategy, should we just say a customer buff? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, I think we should look at a couple of lines before first we\\'ll get to that final sort of hit line, like the punchline. I was looking at company and had a few ideas and confident could help you manage the growing daily messages. They\\'re not really ideas anymore. They\\'re products. They are services. I see the intentionality behind the word ideas. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI hope you manage growing daily messages a few ways. What would you say? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMmm. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMaybe something like just strategies. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFeels kind of long. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI like strategies. Strategies. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPlan. So here I can use and craft a plan to save you both time. Not plan. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. So to show you how confident me and my team are, I wanted to give you a quick overview of how we would level up your business for free. What else? Funnel data. Sales funnel data for vacation rentals. What is their funnel data? What do they do? What do vacation rentals do for, do they do, like, ads? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, I mean, just what I was thinking by sales funnel data is just overall the data of their business, just for us to know how they\\'re going and all that. Because the revenue and the time spent on taking care of messages, just overall their information. Just wanted to make it more fancy. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShould I change sales funnel or no? Maybe it\\'s too specific in terms of they do not know what sales funnel mean. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFor me, it screams, oh, these guys are trying to sell me something. Then again, it is accurate. If we get a view into that, then we can do strategy for them. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMaybe it\\'s something more friendly. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMy issue is now it\\'s ambiguous what exactly we\\'re selling here. Is it like strategies to manage growing daily messages or like optimizing the sales funnel? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd what exactly are you doing with the growing daily messages? Because they could have people answering them. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI mean, inherently, if we take care of the daily messages, we optimize their funnel. It\\'s a question. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, that makes sense. I\\'m worried that would make sense to us and just confuse somebody who doesn\\'t see the connection because we\\'re talking about what we do. What is their dream outcome here? And can we put an example of that dream outcome in there? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I mean, their dream outcome is just to have more time maybe as said long ago, to have time with their family and all that. That\\'s what I think is their desire or something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIf I\\'m not wrong, I think I wrote this because I\\'ve got two of those emails, but the other one is bitch longer. Let me see. Code. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I had a few strategies I\\'m confident will help you manage the growing daily messages we\\'re getting off the season. So daily messages are probably not growing. They\\'re probably going down. But what we could, since it\\'s almost March, what we could say is, like in preparation for the summer season, we have few strategies. It\\'s not really managing because managing. They could hire somebody for $2 an hour to manage the messages. So what is really leave the value here. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo something else I wrote on another email was to decrease the expenses on service reps. So that goes to another. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIncrease expenses on, sorry, service reps. Service reps. I could see it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShould I wrote that instead? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHold off on that thought for a second. Reducing expenses on service reps. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat if we could say the same thing talking about someone else? What if we could say the same thing by. We saw this, we saw X impact on Y company who implemented this and that, or implemented this and. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWho saved thousands of dollars. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I know this outreach method, I think I got it too. Let me search. There are many ways to outreach, and this one is one way to outreach to have. It\\'s called like, you steal someone\\'s authority to use it with you. Basically, something I did with that is basically, hey, I saw that big company, for example, Tripadvisor, is implementing AI in a way that you aren\\'t. And considering they\\'re making millions or even billions, you might consider to take a look on what they\\'re doing or something like that. Let me try. Search the one you told me. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSomething like that. Just simpler. I was thinking from the fundamental rather than from the strategy. From the fundamental of how do we show them that there\\'s something that they want? Because we can go and test it. Hey, let\\'s go and test it. I just don\\'t feel like, oh, yes, this will click because they will know for sure that this is something that they want and that this is something that they need. But we\\'re talking about it as opposed to showing it or showing the results. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. So you mean a case study email? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSure. Case study. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe don\\'t have a case study. That\\'s the problem. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo how I worded it, at no point is there a. We built this for them, but they implemented this and this is the results that they saw, which is totally fair game when it comes to the product itself. We have the product with a few tweaks, we have the product. That\\'s part of why I wanted you to come to the dev meeting today, because we have a lot of products. What you saw today is one of them. Your help will greatly appreciate it. But we have a. This chat bot concierge. And in that chat bot concierge, you do a few tweaks and suddenly it answers all the questions to prospects as opposed to guests. So we\\'re like almost there. We\\'re also asking, is this something that you want? Or maybe it\\'s interactions with your guests that you want to have solved. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo in this initial campaign, we\\'re asking, hey, when people message you to get details about this house or this apartment or this vacation rental, is that a pain point for you? What we could be asking in a future campaign is current guests asking you stuff and one in questions answered right away, is that an issue? And how much are you spending on solving that issue? So that type of clarity is what I feel we need to portray. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCan I say what I think? Yeah, go ahead. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nFinal decision is yours, just so you know. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, it\\'s not that. So for me, everything you\\'re doing on the death thing is actually amazing and all that. But for me, I think it\\'s just better to focus one, two, or at max, three different services and just master them and be the best at that. And then, because I think there\\'s this quote from Alex Ramosi who said something like, you don\\'t need more than one or two niches or one, two, three services. What you need is just to be the best at what you do. And whenever you become the best at what you do, in order to scale, you have to have different approaches and have different niches and all that applies in everything, that applies in outreach, that applies in niches. As I said, that applies for me in the services. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I think we should focus more into one or two services. Just be the best on that, be the best business service, to deliver that service and just be known for that service and deliver so much value that they will just refer to other people. The problem by making all those services, which definitely are great, I\\'m not saying they\\'re not, is that we are sort of forgetting about the quality we want to give up to the clients. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, absolutely, man. Totally right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause, yeah, I think we should be known for, I don\\'t know, for these kind of for one kind of service, two kind of services we should not be known for because, yeah, we can do everything. From my point of view, from prospect\\'s point of view, would you prefer to work with someone that is an expert on this service or would you prefer working with someone that is an expert on everything? So what I mean is that you have more authority when you say I only work on this service because I want the best quality for you and yeah, that\\'s what I think. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, well, let me show you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHow many services do you have right now that you can, what I\\'m about to show you. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI do want your opinion on this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI can\\'t see that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHow about now? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo we have built already the ski chalet concierge, which is the same product, different side of the product. This is a concierge for vacation rentals for guests, for improving the vacation rental experience. Let\\'s solve your customer service questions for potential guests. Is the same chat bot with different prompt, but everything else is actually the same. So that\\'s actually quite interesting. That\\'s why I talk with one step away from converting it. That\\'s something we have built, but not something we want to properly focus on. I think the vacation rental field, we might be onto something and there might be opportunity and we\\'re just trying to dig out whatever opportunity there might be there for an initial client. So this is why we\\'re doing this campaign and we\\'re continuing these campaigns. Scheduler assistant is a more complex product. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is for the logistical nightmare, the logistical pain point of retail companies, for department stores, for having to manage hundreds of employees and have them assigned at different times in different places. Right now most companies do this manually and it\\'s crazy that they do that manually. So there was an opportunity there and we built a product for it. This is something that Henry might actually be able to sell to the company that he works at. So something we finished because we saw potential in for a sale, not necessarily potential of becoming this being the identity of fasterized, which is kind of like along the lines of what you\\'re asking, lead qualifier. This is something we initially built. If we want to do something with this, we need to put some more work. But it\\'s great for ads. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt\\'s great for running ads and actually going straight into a chat for qualification of leads. This is great for us, this is great for any of our clients that a lot of them are going to want marketing work. And this could be an implementation of, yeah, we\\'ll run your ads or we\\'ll improve your website or whatever. And also we have this for getting better leads. Anyway, this is stuff we have worked on in the past. What we\\'re currently working on are three things. A Zoom transcriber, the recording that is happening right now, having a transcription and putting it into a database integration. What that enables is the context is the base of knowledge for any other applications that is very abstract and it will become clearer later on. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo grabbing a call, a recording, making a transcription, and then having that knowledge available for a chat, for example. Knowledge base builder leverages that previous this is essentially one service. This is all essentially one service, which is a knowledge base builder. Grabbing all of the information from the company, including the calls, but also including the documents, the public conversations, their marketing, everything, and putting it in one place. That makes it so. Xxx that makes it so. There\\'s an assistant that accompanies every employee. So there\\'s instant summaries of every meeting and clear action tasks. A lot of things evolve from this knowledge base. Some of the things, for example, are. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGive me a second. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI promise there\\'s a point to this and I\\'ll show you. Okay, this is what that looks like. A knowledge based builder with the context and all the calls, with the transcripts, getting to a point where we have all that knowledge stored, and with that knowledge we can do a lot of different things. People have talked about a personal work coach, essentially an AI assistant, but that can also prioritize work or that can also do product management. Use cases. So this is where the use cases come parts in. Massive outreach system is part of what we\\'ve built, what we\\'ve worked in. And we want to know that when we\\'re sending whatever email, it\\'s relevant. It\\'s relevant to the person we\\'re sending it to. And it\\'s relevant to us too. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe want to know that if we have a fast drive AI assistant, it\\'s relevant that it has the context of the company, of the employees, of the clients, of the products we\\'ve worked on. Part of that context gets gathered by these calls. Hey, what are we working on? What improvements or what has the development team been working on, et cetera, that enables use cases? To answer your question, the core service for faster eyes will be this. But this is very abstract when you can\\'t really just sell this. This is a foundation for an application that can get built from AI dialers, dude, from anything. You need context. So we\\'re going to build this for us. We\\'re going to build other stuff for clients. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHowever, what are those things at the moment, customer service for vacation rental is very low hanging fruit in that way because it\\'s clear what the purpose is to save money on customer service reps. Save time in you having to answer those questions. But the reality is that we don\\'t really want to do that forever. And answering your other question, the industry that we\\'re going into as a focus very soon is real estate. Real estate is going to be one of our big ones, one of our core ones. Actually, scratch that. It\\'s going to be our core industry. We have some contacts. We\\'re meeting up with some people this week. We\\'re figuring out what is it exactly that they want and need and building that and the process of building that. We\\'re like, halfway through, I\\'m going to stop. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut anyway, through building that real estate product, then we\\'re going to mass sell, mass outreach. And we already have about almost a million contacts after we validate addresses, probably between three and 400,000 people across the US, real estate agents, we have their contacts. So that\\'s set up. We just need to. This week, Paige and I are sitting down with real people in the real world, which is very rare for us, being so remote and digging through the details and getting some sales. So through those sales is. Oh, other real estate agents might want this. For example, a potential buyer or a potential seller. A potential buyer is messaging the real estate agent. Hey, have you found anything new? Have you found anything new? And it could be very easy to implement. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHey, here are these three new listings you might be interested in, based on the three listings you saw last week or the three listings I shared for you, and it\\'s an automatic SMS. That is something that real estate agents in general have shown interest in. Is that our product? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMaybe. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe point is, this week we\\'re solidifying the use case and the industry, which we already know that we\\'re going to properly focus on moving forward. So why do all these email stuff for vacation rental? Number one, practice, because we need to have solid outreach. And that\\'s why I\\'m so excited about you taking on that. So you can give it a sort of full focus into making as good frameworks, as good emails as you can and getting evidence for how good they are. And number two, because we actually might be able to get some sales through these. So that\\'s the chapel. That\\'s where we\\'re headed. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. That makes more sense. Now. I have nothing to say for what you describe. I\\'m pretty hopeful and have many, let\\'s say. I think this can actually work. And if it does, we can get a lot of money out of this, because it\\'s, in my opinion, pretty unique. And not many people are doing this, I guess. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I think you\\'re right. And we\\'ll go and test it. Until we have evidence. We won\\'t know. So let\\'s go get that evidence. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut just the thing is that, for example, wouldn\\'t you have the opportunity to make this after we get the client, or this needs to be done before. Right now? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat\\'s a good question. Yes and no. We are sitting down with real estate agents this week to talk to them about that and maybe even build those things for them. So we have the case study. We have like, hey, these were the results of what we built for this person anyway, for this real estate agent. Here are the results. Here\\'s what happened. So, we will have something built, but our new person might want something different. So the core will be the same, and we\\'ll have one, two, maybe three sellable products after a while. But we will start with, this is what they want. Let\\'s build it for them. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I see. Of course. So just have the foundation. Because I was thinking that, of course. I think that, as I\\'ve said hundreds and hundreds of times, the output should be the focus. And I was thinking that after we get the client, we can build that service, or we can build that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nExactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhatever. And if we can build that thing whenever we get assigned and not before, I think we should shift our perspective and shift our focus towards outreach. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI see what you\\'re saying. See, I think you\\'re correct. And I\\'ve been learning the difference between being correct and being right. I think you\\'re correct in that what you\\'re saying makes absolute sense. Being right is a little more nuanced. I also think you\\'re right. I also think that now is the time where we should put as much focus from as many people as possible into outreach and getting clients. I think the timing is right. I think development is ready, and I think now that you have these two weeks, which is super exciting, it\\'s like, okay, let\\'s just make this happen. Okay, so, outreach. Focus on outreach. But, dude, what we\\'ve been building last four months made it. So I don\\'t know if you heard this story. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nPaige and I went to an event, an AI event, where this guy was talking about chat GBT and how to use it and how to make it useful. And before the event started, we talked to the guy, and he told us, dude, I\\'m, like, sharing these things that I\\'m learning, but you guys are actually building these things. Would you like to come up on stage to share some of what you do? Yeah. Halfway through the talk, he\\'s like, there\\'s some people here from another country that want to share some cool stuff that they are building. I\\'m just talking about it, but they\\'re building it. And we go up on stage and were so comfortable. We felt like we knew exactly what the fuck were talking about. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd we\\'ve been building these for now four months, which is like, oh my God, we\\'ve been building for four months and we haven\\'t been focusing on outreach. But even Paige, who\\'s not a programmer, was able to get up on stage and be like, this is exactly what we do, and this is exactly how it works, and this is exactly how it can help you. It was mind blowing, man. It was how ready were to just improvise, get up on stage and talk about who we are and what we do. And I think that\\'s very powerful. Any more focus we put into anything that isn\\'t outreach, any focus we take away from outreach now is not going to have the same return that the first focuses on. Hey, let\\'s build some products so we get comfortable with building. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo we get sort of a muscles warmed up. We\\'re there. We\\'re very much there. The speed of development that Kuba and Bartek and Henry have is incredible now. Much better than before. So we\\'re ready to have a client have a call and then build a prototype within days, which is fucking awesome. And it\\'s very rare in the development world. So I want to give you that context. There was a purpose to focusing on stuff that isn\\'t solely outreach. And right now we have the emails, we have the industry super clear. We have the. We have some tests of frameworks that we want to use and how they\\'ll fit together. And we have one initial idea of a product that real estate agents might be interested in. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd in this week, we\\'re going to solidify, we\\'re going to build, say, these two things, and this is what we\\'re going to go sell. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, yeah, I just didn\\'t understand for the last part. Do you want the dev team to work on the outreach or you want them to keep working on the project you\\'re doing? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWell, the outreach project is going really well. They\\'re going to continue working on it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBecause I\\'ll get to show you its full capabilities later, there\\'s useful stuff there. It just needs guidance. I\\'m so excited for you to guide it in the human way. However, when a project comes in that has any potential, even if it\\'s just a conversation that we have with a real estate agent and it has any potential of becoming something we sell for money, then the focus is going there. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, of course. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, absolutely. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nFor now, they\\'re having good momentum on this project, so let them do their thing. And they\\'re engaged and it\\'s very important to keep them engaged. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo let\\'s give one last look at your email. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOla Mama Yorg, come with us. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I\\'m sorry, my mom just came in. I think you heard her. Yeah, maybe I\\'ll have to go in like five minutes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, five minutes is all we need. Could you flash screen and we\\'ll get. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThose emails sent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHere. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCan you see? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo you want to change this, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI have two questions if you go to the very top of that one. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHere. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. Why are those two lines separated? Is that a thing? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhere? Here? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. I thought I\\'d run this by you because it\\'s a pretty good. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou can do that for me. It\\'s more aesthetic to the eye, but I don\\'t know, just my thing. I just like it like that. It doesn\\'t matter what it is. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd then I was looking at company and had a few strategies. I\\'m confident going to help you manage growing daily messages. So to show how confident me and my team are, I want to give you a quick overview of how we would level up your business for free. We\\'ll take a look at your data and craft a strategy to save you both time and money. If you\\'re open to the idea, would you be against a quick chat about cool, sounds good. And do we want to put Alex and then the title, no, Alex. And then the role at the company. Alex. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe can do that. So we can do two things. So we either go the formal way. So Alex, founder or something like that. Or Alex, your AI tech buddy, but not buddy, but something like that. Like something more friendly. I don\\'t know. We can do one of both. What do you. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that one sounded fun. Alex, AI, your new. That makes it seem like an AI wrote this message. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYour AI tech buddy. Your AI expert buddy. Tech buddy. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, that\\'s good. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. Alex, your AI tech buddy, Alex. Alex. Yeah, no hyphen as in like the. Yeah, that works. You\\'re a tech buddy. Cool. Sounds good, man. That\\'s fun. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShould I add this one to you on the other? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes, let\\'s do that. And I am going to work on getting you the right emails and we\\'ll send it in a couple of hours. We\\'ll make sure it\\'s sent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet\\'s add some words to make it more deep and cool. 2 seconds. My mother is calling me again. I keep the last one without it because it\\'s kind of. If you read it\\'s more direct and formal. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n1 second. What\\'s that? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, sounds good. Sounds good. Okay, cool. Good job, man. I will let you know when the leads are uploaded into instantly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, perfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. Awesome. I\\'ll see you soon, Ben. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, awesome, brother. Good job. See you. Bye. Yeah.

Hey Bartek, how you doing man? Let's park the conversation on the knowledge base for Friday when we have Pablo. Also about that, what time do you leave? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat time do you have to go to the next thing? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's not like I have a meeting. I just need to do something. So the faster the better. Let's discuss the out system and the knowledge-based stuff. You were trying to ask how we at Syllabus envision this knowledge-based system, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, that was one of my questions. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, so we don't have that figured out at all and now we're in a kind of chaotic situation with so many things going on. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat I was asking more was what are the components? So the same image that you showed us last time, going over those components again, because now I'm reviewing what components deserve to be there, and what components have to be there, and what components deserve the most attention. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, can we do it? Maybe you could just write me those components. I will think about it and I have time probably in the evening. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh yeah, it's written. I wrote the technical report. I can send that to you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSuper. Then we can actually look at some code together. I will have time in the evening if you want to make a call out, say 5 hours from now or 6 hours from now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'll make it work. Yeah, sounds good.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo let's go to the outer system first of all. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHi everyone. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMaybe I'll make a short introduction of how we met and how it all started that Hubert joined Celebrities. So first past year I've been doing some trainings for developers and Hubert was part of the flutter team. And it kind of developed because I pivoted my personal career from mobile development to AI. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI think basic is good for now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhen I'm off trying to tie the ends together so we can thrive in this AI space and have the income that we all need. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFor now, I'm good. I'm trying to catch up and understand everything you're doing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMy background personally is in data science. Five years of Python and a lot of distributed computing and such, still very much into data analysis and data science. Is Python one of your interests or are you leaning more towards JavaScript web development?\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI think both. JavaScript is more for specific tasks for me, but Python is, I don't know, more universal. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd have you played around with any assistance API? OpenAI?\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAssistance OpenAI. Yeah. I have created some virtual agents. I call it GTPs for many tasks. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUsing Chatterbt or GPTs in your daily life is probably the only prerequirement that exists here. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, so I guess I decided to go full time in just AI and AI agency about six months ago, seven months ago. And it's just been a journey, man, and it's been so much fun. I really think we're onto something.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe're on something with the adjunctic system. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI have an existential question about this agentic system actually. We are sending an email at the end of the process, right? Why wouldn't we use some kind of email marketing machine? But I'm not sure about instantly AI. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I'm thinking this system we're building, this agency system, should end on the excel. The objective here would be to have the excel, let's say we have from the navigator the excel data, and then it takes the input and outputs enriched Excel where we have all those variables we set in this email machine. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is exactly what we're aiming to do. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe haven't played around with the instantly API yet, but we did buy the subscription that gives us access to the instantly API. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhoever kind of raises their hand first to go figure out the API where we step forward with that. But it's not necessarily urgent if we don't have the emails first, and it shouldn't be that complicated. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMaybe let's try instantly because I've been thinking about other systems. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhich other system were you thinking of?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI was thinking about Smart Leads. And this is basically something like instantly, but you can either link your HubSpot, your whole CRM to it, or you can just send a CSV file where you have columns with the variable names. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, that's good. I would be very surprised if we weren't able to do that with instantly. Whenever we find a need for a CRM per se like HubSpot, we can come around to that. It doesn't feel extremely urgent.Speaker 5\\nStill paying for go high level as well because we've got our CRM and it's got hosting the website. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt is hosting the website isn't. Yeah, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd we graded instantly so that the API would work with go high level. And then I'm not sure we ever did anything about. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, right. Because we have the go high level CRM. Right. Let's pause on that conversation because that's a kind of bigger systems integration conversation and probably not super necessary right now. At the moment, all the leads that we have are mainly through the files that I found, essentially lead files. As we step into the real estate market, we have hundreds of thousands of contacts that we're going to send these emails to. So at that point we probably want something that is more organized like a CRM. Point is, given the speed that we need to go to right now and the little time we have to sort of get together. Yes, I'm going to write down, let's have that bigger systems integration conversation. As of right now, let's talk about the outreach system. But thank you for bringing that up. Bartek and smart leads. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe will keep it in mind if we have any blockers with instantly. We do have two email campaigns running right now. Instantly from emails that Jorg and Zach made. So emails are being sent. That's in line. And you guys asked. Well, no, I brought up last time, hey, what might it look like to have an email framework that this system can get, say, inspired by or a framework to follow when writing emails? I want to very quickly run Hoobie and all of you through this sequence I made because there's a couple tweaks and I just want us to agree on that these tweaks are the right way to go. I want to say, and I'm going to repeat it, do not worry about token usage right now. Token usage in our production system is going to be much lower. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut in our test system, we need to figure out what the best outputs are. I'm going to leave it at that. So research agent objective is simple. Gather prospect info. We have two ways to do this right now. There is a relevance AI tool that gets profile information, that gets recent posts, pretty much gets everything. It's pretty amazing. So we're going to get LinkedIn profile and LinkedIn posts. The tool that Kubai is using gets profile. I'm not sure that it gets posts. It works for right now, but it lacks depth. Anyway, what we want to do in the future also is get the company website and company analysis. So hey, say we're going for real estate. Okay, great. What aspect of real estate? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBecause actually there's between twelve and 16 different people organizations that get involved in a real estate, in the sale of a house at any one point throughout the whole process. So what aspect of real estate is this company in? And what aspect of that company, in that process is this person in? So company analysis and company website are going to become important, but it's not immediate need right now. With LinkedIn posts and LinkedIn profile, it's a great way to have enough information to create an email. What about the profile? What about the posts? That's what we have the data analyst agent for find. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou. But I'm thinking why not make something like something we need the most right now? Like a very thin layer of what we think need the most now. And let's say maybe get those LinkedIn information into bullet point for the sales team so they can know what's faster. Don't going through all the information, just faster. Know what basically would be later output of this whole system. But now we make it use this first part and then later human. And later in the next iterations we bring more AI, more AI. And push the human to the further of the process. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo what you're saying is we get these two, or maybe even these three up and running and we let the human do the rest for now. And then we might get another step, say draft emails and then the human corrects the emails, is that what you're saying? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. And throughout this process we need to gather data. Every time email is corrected by human, we need to get that shit written down. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is so good, man. Yes, that is such a good point. Okay. Yeah, I 100% support that idea. In fact, I was going to give an example of exactly what you just said, but in a different way. So let's stage one. Stage one, introduce human here. And in that stage one, maybe we can go in icebreakers. Why icebreakers and not data analyst? These gold nuggets aren't necessarily going to be bullet points. They're usually going to be short paragraphs. Why? Because there needs to be enough substance in there to say yes, this is what we're going to leverage about this person, about the post that they made to create an icebreaker. But also that data is very important to say. That is what's most important when we're writing the email. And then that is what's most important when we have the email critic. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we need some substance to these insights. I want to show you an example of that really quickly. What might those insights look like? Services overview relevant to dance solo this is about us, what services we might provide. But this is the paragraph that I'm envisioning. Given Dan's involvement in running a ski lodge and consulting on technical integrations, our AI power automations to streamline operational processes. This might include booking, management, whatever. What if this paragraph is about Dan? That would be the point here. And the second paragraph is, hey, they posted about the whatever AI changes in their industry. Oh, okay. Let's make reference to that post. So we need a paragraph of what. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat post was about. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe icebreakers can be some sort of bullet points. Let's talk more on that point later. What exactly we give the human yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think it's right now and I think what we should do is assume we are doing this for the client. And let's say the client is the sales team. And what we need to do first to make an automation of the sales team. We need to make a workshop. We need to make analysis of what they do. And I think the important thing in here is also like I've been thinking about little how that fits that developers make a system that makes sales team work less. And I had some initial thought, but I don't want to bring it up right now. That's conversation for later. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut now I'm thinking actually of mitigating the thing by having sales team help build this and really have their input and sort of not record, but have written down all their process and all their thoughts and how they do it. And then we make AI version of the sales team rather than. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is something that we've already started. So this is part of that integration. Let me get to the end and I think you'll start seeing how. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n100% agree with you. So who is the sales team? Zach, Jorg and me. Not necessarily only the outreach team but we're talking sort of who knows the sales frameworks, who knows the email framework. So in that perspective of having the sales input into this on Friday, I'm actually talking with Zach and we're going deeper into this. That's why I want to review this with you guys to make sure that this is making sense and that I'm on the right track to then sort of translate it to Zach. I think this is such a good point. And this is definitely something that Zach almost in a different way, agreed on. It's like, well, let's make the training data. Let's make the training data ourselves so we can keep guiding each of these agents. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe should assume that developers cannot sell like they don't know how to sell, so they cannot make a system to sell without the salespeople. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's very good awareness. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we're not building something out in the cloud. We're trying to make a basically digital twin to our salesforce. That's how we should keep it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's go. Because I have very time. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI know. And you're asking about what is relevant. We actually met up with one of the lead, I'm going to simplify it. Real estate agents in Maryland yesterday and tomorrow we're meeting with another one. And that's the industry we're tackling. So this that you're saying is like, well, what is relevant? What exactly is our offer? What are we selling? That is very much in process of definition and it's been quite productive. So stay tuned on that and we'll talk more about that on Friday. All right. Okay, so we have the researcher agent get the info, the data analyst. What info is relevant? So how do we define relevance? The fasterized knowledge base, we need to create an ICP, who's our ideal customer profile, et cetera. Iceberg, your creator. Create relevant hooks, first lines, and through those first lines write simple, human, impactful emails. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nObviously that's not going to be the full prompt, but now we're leveraging the icebreakers, we're leveraging the faster ICE knowledge base. So it's like, oh, this is the products that we're making for real estate agents. So it knows what to fit in there based on the profile, based on the company. Obviously they leverage these gold nuggets about the profile. And this is one of the things that you're talking about. Examples of good and better. So very quickly, examples of good and better. This is the first version that we ran. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWrite a concise, human casual email to Dan, gave him his whole LinkedIn profile and this is what it wrote. You don't need to read it, but it's long. If it covers more than the page, then it's definitely way too long. Paragraphs need to be short, et cetera. I stumbled upon your impressive profile and couldn't help by none of that. None of that. Be much less corny and more human casual. So, quick chat, maybe I would remove this. Hey, Dan, I came across your profile and snowball chalet caught my eye. I mean, who wouldn't want to escape to the Japanese Alps? Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe need a devil advocate agent that knows what our best salesman knows. I don't know who is the best salesman, but ask him about the emails from the AI we have currently and what he don't like. And then we put that into the devil advocate. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBro, you're reading my mind. Yes. That is exactly what we're doing with Zach. Zach is our g when it comes to. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSure. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRecord the meeting and have the transcripts from that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAbsolutely. This is the first email. What don't we like? Okay. We don't like this. We don't like that. Perfect. This is a better email. What don't we like? We don't like this. We don't like that. This would be the best email. And that is one example of how we're going to few shot prompt this writer agent. This is the initial. This is better and this is best. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNow that I'm glad that we got there with a justification of why, of course. And we're going to add an email framework in there. So we have to. And this is for the future. We're going to let it free form first and we're going to leverage Zach and me in order to help guide it a little bit, create good examples. So the output is a variety of emails, one for each icebreaker. What is about these icebreakers? We don't know. Which ones are the effective ones? We don't know. You created categories. PFA created some categories. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's great. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's wonderful. Which ones are the effective categories? Let's go test those. And for that, we actually need to write emails once for each icebreaker. This is not set in stone, by the way. This is just my idea of how we can explore while refocusing day by day to make the agents better. Email critic. The objective is going to be choosing the most useful icebreakers. So this email critic may be in this step as opposed to after writing the email, this is left to see. We're evaluating. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think we will add depth later and I think we need a critic at every intersection of this system. Like every generating agent should have critic agent every time. But let's have depth at later versions and now focus on the bare bones and what we need. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, sounds good. So email writer, you leverages the icebreakers, creates a draft. Email critic evaluates the icebreakers and the draft, and it'll output essentially a nine out of ten. Five out of ten. How can we prompt it to go with what we want? How many people out of 100 would actually answer this email before evaluating? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nImagine you are ICP. You can add it before the how it should imagine that it's ICP. And from perspective of ICP, do this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAwesome, awesome. And then a written critique of what needs improvement, which it learns through all these examples of what is good and what is better with the justification. And then we go back to the email writer, say we choose one or two versions of the email and we. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRepeat, this is actually not it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRewrite emails, final emails. And then we go back to the email critic. And if the email critic says no, that doesn't work, then we go back and there might be a loop here. We might do one iteration. We always obviously don't want them iterating forever, but this is pretty much the same. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis critic is, I'm thinking of another critic agent. Not exactly critic agent, but we could have at the end of this process, client agent. And this client agent would be biased to not want to buy and leaves reasons why this email doesn't make me buy. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou're on fire, dude. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nClient agent. Three reasons why this email doesn't want to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBuy or I guess reply. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, love it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo I think that you're onto something, Bartek. We need to have something finished. And that something I think is these three steps being able to run. The reason I brought up, I wouldn't call what I brought up refactoring simply because I guess what I was thinking of is productionizing. So let's make sure that we can give this program a list of 1000 leads and that it does this for the 1000 just systematically. Right now, the code that Kuba wrote, gray code, doesn't allow us for this parallelization. So a next step is parallelizing the steps. Maybe it's running the file, say through a terminal 1000 times in parallel, or maybe it's some loop within the program. So running the program once and multithreading so we can talk about that later for sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAs of right now, let's make sure that we have these three threads as solid as they can be, say that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAgain, you thought about assistant API threads. Doesn't this allow to run it in parallel? Let's just maybe note that for later. Check it out. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I don't know that you can do multiple calls to the assistant API with the same API key in parallel. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think it was the same way. You can use GPT in parallel in different. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPart. Okay, I'm going to leave a note and we can find out. Okay, what questions does anybody have? Kuba, does this go in line with. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI would like to go in two minutes, so can we save questions for where I go? And just one thing, I wanted to just write that down about the thread of assistance API thread. And I had one more comment. Let me gather my thoughts. Oh, I got it. You ready to the part we will be delivering right now, the productionized three steps. I'm thinking we should make it fit the variables we have instantly or whatever we're using right now for sending emails. So let's make it like I lost it again, because with the icebreakers, just maybe list variables for the email. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, list variables. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFor example, the name, the company. Those are the two that we're using right now instantly. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo those should be easy ones. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. So we would have like you can put in here the screenshot I sent in the prompt factory channel where we have this template. And this could be some more variables. Where am I going here? This part will not automate the whole work, but we can connect it with. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThis. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nEmail marketing machine. Right. So we want out to be those variables in here and we will call it an MVP. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, so what you're saying is let's make sure that we can add to instantly a new lead with the columns name, company and icebreaker. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, for starter, something like that. Later I would make something more. Instead of icebreaker, I would, for example, hook, twist, whatever later comes or different variants of those things does definitely need the mind of Safeman to know the specifics. But you get where I'm going, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, of course. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, cool. I think that's all for me. And I got to run. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's what you mean by the interesting twist. Okay, opening hook about AI automation and then. Interesting twist. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Yes. So let's continue this conversation after I speak with Zach and actually give this a look. But it feels like now that we introduce the human, we'll be able to get very good examples for properly, hopefully many shot prompting each agent. And that gives me hope, that gives me confidence that it'll allow for more reliability because that's the main issue here, you can write one good email. Can you write 20 good emails? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we'll work on that later after we get this. That's specific, but I think we have more control over the temperature, let's say, and other settings while we're doing init code. So I'm hopeful that we can manage that later on. All right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOn that point then the critic would probably be the most important agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Or the client. The client agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe client agent. Okay, I'll look into that because that will be very specific by industry. And now we're getting good information about the real estate industry. Thank you, Bartek. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, can you walk through Hubert on the code on the call up? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe can. We're meeting up in a few hours with Kuba and we can go over some of the code. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, so another call? Yeah, I got it correctly. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, a different. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo can you catch that with Hubert later on? I got a bounce. Hubert, ask questions if you have. So ask questions. Guys can answer. And I got around. See you later. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSee you, Bartek. While all of you are here, I want to open the floor to questions. I'm glad that Bartek was here to sort of speed up the whole process, but it might have been too fast, although some of us are familiar with the system. So questions. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, I understand there is one more meeting today. Which hour? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCuba. 07:00 p.m. GMT works for you. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\n07:00 p.m. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIs that outreach one? Because we don't have outreach tomorrow. Yeah. Okay, we'll just add one into scheduling then. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's in scheduling outreach at 07:00 p.m. Gym tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, but is that the one we're on about for later? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTo be clear. 07:00 p.m. GMT. Tomorrow or today? Today. Okay, it's fine for me. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. Awesome. Kuba, could you confirm that time does work for you? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd then there's that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd let me just make sure that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI don't miss this 1 second. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow familiar are you with Langchain? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLangchain? I did some project with prompt engineering in GTPs. I don't know if it's the same, but I did some swarm. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFun, but nothing special. I know, what is this? But I did a few projects with it. I'm at the beginning, I would say. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo I'm going to share a video. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWith you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd just watch it before our meeting. You won't really be modifying this code, but obviously understanding what is going on. Where does tools come in? Where do agent creation comes in is important just to keep track. And we are going to be, obviously, walking through the code at 07:00 p.m. And also looking at the prompts. So there's going to be a mix of, you're going to see the code, and it's like, oh, yes, this is what the agent does because the prompt is there, so it's relatively easy to follow. I'll send you a video on Langchain, or rather Kuba. Henry, if you guys can pull up a video that has worked for you, something simple that talks about, hey, this is memory, this is et cetera, that talks about the seven components. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNothing too complex, but I know you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGuys have gotten into, so I don't know if you, Henry, have gone into Langchain. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I did a lang chain course on the plane, like, back in August. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDid you say on the plane? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I bought plane wifi and just did the whole course. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, that's so cool, dude. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's great. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI've dropped the course that I did for. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe can definitely get around to the course. Just wanted to. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIf you go in there's sections, so you'll probably recognize a few bits. So you can just choose memory or stuff like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. I know how easy it is to get overwhelmed by a whole course. We will start simpler. And, yes, the course is a great. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCall for diving deeper. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, this works. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI've seen this one before. Dope. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, that course is a great find, dude. And what's been going on with the last thing were working on? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI have not touched it since. I had to do some stuff this morning. I've decided, like, basically, my dad got injured and can't do a half marathon in six weeks. So I decided I'm just going to try train and do it. So I went on a run and absolutely killed myself this morning. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWait, what? Injured? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI don't think he trained enough. Dad basically dropped out of the half marathon. I just said, I'll do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's awesome, dude. Glad to hear that's an awesome objective. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. But, yeah, so that's what I was doing this morning, and then I was hoping to get back to it. But, yeah, we're just at the same point as. I can share my screen. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, let's get into it. We're going to get into some code, you guys. So if you need to leave, feel free to leave. If you want to stay and look at what we're working on, we stay. This is going to be a retrieval augmented generation system simplified. This is Henry giving a good go at it. And then we're going to use it for. We'll start with our. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLet me share screen. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThere we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI do have to leave in about. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nProbably 15 minutes, by the way, but fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, you can probably this little bit and then I can get going. So we're at the point where we've vectorized our database that we want to then put into. We've made embeddings and now we want to put it into the vector database. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo we want the name of the student as metadata and data frame with the ID, which is basically the index, the metadata and the average story vector, which we have in this. So we've got one and two ID could just be index. How do I put that into a data frame? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd then this is a great question. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThis is the code we're going to be doing. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBye, Kuba. See you soon. Yeah. Let's work on creating that data frame. There's a few ways to do it. There's grabbing the previous data frame and putting stuff in it. Kind of like slicing. It is called slicing where you just grab the name column and then you include the vectors column. So that's one way to do it. There's a very important thing to keep track of when you're working with data frames. Am I using the full amount of rows? We started with like 23,000 rows, but there's not 23,000 vectors there. Do you remember how many there are? Yes. So we need to do the exact same thing if we're going to create a new data frame. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHow do I do 200 instead of just it's colon? Oh yeah, you're right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. And if you're doing a string, it's because it's a column in a simplified manner. But you're not doing column, you're saying rows. I want the first hundred rows. So it's just a number. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo now that you have the first hundred, how do you know that those hundred are that Tomasibara is the one that corresponds to the first array of the first vector. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nData frame story zero. The first vector should have been Thomas Abara. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo when you passed it's in the same order. You never randomized anything. But that's another thing to keep track of. So we have 100 vectors, we have 100 names. Now we need to put them together. So let's do that. You're going to say, like you said, new DF. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we might need a couple of tries in order to do that. But equals PD, create capital D. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou should be able to do autocomplete. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTab autocomplete. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWell, when I pick tab, I don't think it's unless I do it in a new. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWeird. That's strange. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, no worries. Create data capital D and frame capital F. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou open the parentheses and now you want to insert the data. How are we going to do that? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMy understanding, you just need a new free columns. One column for index. One column. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe index is going to be automatic. You're automatically going to create an index and I'll show you how. You pull out the index to make it a column. But we'll get there in a second. So the index is created automatically and now you have the values that you need and the metadata. So that's what we're going to call the columns. But first you insert the data. How are we going to do that? One way to do that is let's try it this way. You're going to create a list. So brackets. And inside the list you're going to put the two columns. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's one comma. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, it doesn't let me also complete. That's so annoying. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, we'll figure that out later. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we're going to try. Pandas has no funny, just data frame. Oh yeah, I'm thinking of Spark. I'm thinking of a different framework. Okay. Yeah, just data frame. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I was thinking that's a bit long for pandas. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is exactly how you do things. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou just search it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd now built in how get indexer. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBuilt in function method has no attribute indexer. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nList of serious two arrays. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nList of series two arrays. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo it should be able to, okay, we're going to try, number one, adding the column names. So at the end of data frame, DF stories, embeddings. At the end of that list we're going to do comma columns. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we're going to do equal and then a list. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMy keyboard just died. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nTragic. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou want to do the brackets. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLike this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is parentheses. Brackets is going to be square brackets. So columns equals brackets. And what are we going to put in that list? Because the brackets create a list. So doing parentheses, it's similar to doing only brackets. For now we just want to do brackets. So we're going to inside the brackets where it says list. We're actually going to remove list and we're going to put the names of the columns. So what do you want to call that first column? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhy is my keyboard not working? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAre they both bluetooth? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBoth my keyboards aren't working. Wait, I'm typing on the screen. It's so weird. All right, let me stop the screen. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSharing them. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLet'S keep the name and. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHold on. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCan you see my screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHello? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSince they're column names, they're going to be strings. Cool. And I see a double bracket. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSorry. Why is there story instead of stories? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'll show you in a second. So where is the bracket misplaced. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHenry? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOne bracket. Bracket is fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe have two components here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo this is one component, which is the list, and then this is another component. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat's where it was. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere you go. Okay, so let's try that one. I'm also remembering panda syntax, so step. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBy step, get indexer. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, now we're gonna. Now we're gonna do one more thing, which is we're going to take the brackets and we're going to convert them into parentheses. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI know you only have 15 minutes. Can I give you control? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I can show you. What was your question, Hooby? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThere is columns, line, and there is in bracelet, name and story. Yeah, that orange one. I know where. I know what is name, but I don't know why there is story. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nInstead of embedding stories, for example. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. Could be stories. I just named it singular. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou can call it number one. You can call it whatever you want. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nNumber two. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, stories could be also relevant. But I want you, Henry, to look at the piece of code that you copy pasted at the very end. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere's neither a name nor story in there. What are the things that we do see? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, let's just rename it to metadata and values. So much. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nExactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that level of abstraction that were talking about yesterday, is this because now you can clone this notebook for a different use case and you don't have to change it? You don't have to change name and story because the metadata and the values might be different. You can call it the same thing. So there's one more thing we're going to try. I'm going to request control. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. So. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight here, we're going to try changing this from a bracket to a parentheses. What that does is create a tuple instead of a list. Does tuple sound familiar? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSounds familiar. It's like a dictionary, right? Or similar. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt is. It is the difference between how you have. You can have a list and there's a different thing called a dictionary and it does different things. Well, a tuple is similar to a list, but it does numbers, but it will have different functionalities. As of right now, this changed nothing. So we'll stop the tuple lesson and you don't need to worry about that. So let's go back to basics. What is not working? Data needs to be an array. Nd array means multiple dimensions, multiple dimension array. So more than any number of dimensions, in this case we have two dimensions, the names and the story embeddings. So that should be fine. It's asking for an iterable. An iterable is, for example, a list. You can iterate through the list or a data frame. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt contains series constants. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThen we go index. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIndex is non. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIndex to use for resulting frame will default to range index if no indexing information is given. So this is fine. Range index is fine. Columns index or array like column labels to use. If data contains column labels, we'll perform column selection instead. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nData contains column selection. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, no. And copy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes, we will get there. So. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is the issue that I'm seeing. We're trying to pass an array on each line. Okay, so we're trying to pass an array of arrays, but we're also trying to pass a series. These are not the same type and this might be an issue. I wonder what PDDF to list might be like. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nConvert pandas data frame to a list. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd it's just values to list. So that might be what we want. And trust me, these become automatic over time. Let's see, two columns passed past data had 100 columns. So what might this be doing wrong? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMaking 100 columns instead of 100 rows. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nJust want to see it is doing that, isn't it? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMmm. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat's weird because we have the columns initiated after. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's saying that we have 100 columns. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat doesn't make sense. What if chat GPC here, chat GBt. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's probably the move. There is one thing I want to try though. What if we zip this? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo I'm not about to go teach you what zip is because it's complicated. But we have two lists of things. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd I'm just going to show you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat that looks like now. Hopefully it's right. Yeah, there we go. So we have two lists of things. We turn this into a list and this is already a list. A list of lists. But it counts as a list. They both have 100 elements. The issue is that were passing a list and then a list. What we wanted to do was, hey, the first element of this list and the first element of this list go together. The second element and the second element go together. So when you have two lists and you want to say, pass each row, the first element, and the first element into this data frame. What you use is zip. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI'll have to get more experience just firsthand eventually to understand that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. What I said yesterday was these are great videos to come back to. So we'll definitely archive them and have them well documented because little by little it'll start making sense and coming back to these built on each other. So you have the data frame now, which is the important part. You have 100 elements. And let's figure out where we go from here. I'm just going to change a few variable names and let you take it from there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe have new DF. This would be new DF. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFor in row. It is called metadata. We don't have the ID. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, sorry, go ahead. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe don't have the ID. Right. I said that the index, we can pull it up later. That's with reset index. So now we have the index. However, this is not saved. We're going to. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIndex and this is. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow we're going to save this. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo there's one more thing to do. Copy. You can ignore that. Oof. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf you're grabbing something from a different data frame, always do this. Otherwise you can have some behaviors that become weird. You might be modifying the previous data frame without intending to copy. Says, don't modify anything from the previous data frame. So when creating a new data frame from a data frame, you usually want that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt's just good practice in general. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, so now we have the column index. So instead of ID, this is going. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nTo be row index and this should be values metadata. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I will let you take it from here. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLet's run it. Let's see. Thomas Ibara is a name and this is the first. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo. I'm going to get in there real quick. That is one of the issues. But not on that line and the above line. Yeah, that's actually not. I'm not going to get into it. So try removing that line. Try commenting it out. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWell, where's meta used again? So we're going to have to rename that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. And it's actually going to be row. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBrackets, metadata. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd do you see why row? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, in fact, I don't know why row. If it was me and I was just spitballing it, I would have done that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhich you kind of did up there when you started the for loop. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo this is a for loop. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh, row for I in. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRow. Right. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. For I in. Yeah, this is like, yeah, I kind of will need more explaining of this. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes, I'll get it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWorking. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd then we will talk tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. Let's see. Index key error. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIndex. Let's see where that happens. Row. Row at index. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBecause I call it wrong. I didn't change the name when I added the index. I call that new DF, underscore index. And I didn't change it there. It's just new DF. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. You know when you wrote that, I had that in my brain and I just forgot it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll the instances. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. That should be good. Malform notice or strength. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Yeah, that literal eval, you can remove that. I wonder. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat it was that made them do that. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWell, their metadata was a JSon or just curly brackets. Right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is for values. Oh, yeah, you're right. In that case. That's why they did it. But in values, you have an array, you have a list, and it worked. In this case, when you see the word array, it refers to a numpy array, not a python list. That is when array shows up. So maybe we can just have it be a list. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow do we do that? If we say row values, instead of removing that, let's try removing that, see what happens. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, it worked later on. We have any problems with pine cone interpreting that array? This would be the reason why. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIndex. Describe index stats, where this index defined pine cone. Oh, yeah. I've got index defined as a. Do I have it? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDo you have it? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, index. Index is a variable. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDid it actually. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, we have an issue here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBecause we wrote index as that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that's interesting that you bring that up. That is the name of a column within a data frame. That's not a variable, so they're not going to mess with each other. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut when we go to turn it into a variable, if we ever need to, we might mess up. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd that's why we want more separated names. Yes. We wouldn't want to repeat at this point. We're good. Let's just move forward. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. Back to database. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRun that. Oh, I. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSee. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe issue with changing those things so early on in the code is that if something breaks, you don't know where in the code it broke and how to. Generally, you want to change the variables later in the code, not earlier in the code, but right now we just need to move forward, Henry. So it's fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt works. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's just see one thing. Nothing, actually. Yeah, that's good. Nothing actually uploaded. Can you see why? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh, yeah. I thought it was crazy that it all did it at once. Yeah, this is why. Right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is exactly why. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo it did one nine tells me. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt went zero when it tried to upset what happened. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhich then explains why that, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, yeah, I guess so. I guess it does explain that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHave a dictionary that. Okay, so eval is going to grab a string and try to make it into an object, into a dictionary, into a list, into a math equation, into whatever. So you want to use eval when you have a string but you want it to be something else. In this case we would want Tomasibara to be the name. So we actually need to go back a little and modify that column. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNow how would we do that's. We need to have the column. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet'S see. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we could do some tricky magic. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat should work. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I'm going to take control for a second and I'm just going to do a shortcut. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSpeedrun. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, Speedrun. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we want metadata to be a dictionary as it asked down here to be a dictionary, but it's a string right now. Well, what we can do is say, hey, this name, make it into, insert. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBelow. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMake it into something different, something that looks like a dictionary. And that's where the trick comes in. We want to say, wait. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, because in the other version if you go to the learning the other notebook, it is a dictionary because they have the chunk, they have the source. That's dictionary values. There. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI see the trick here is that it looks like a dictionary but it's a string. And eval, or again this case literal eval, makes the string into what it's representing. In this case it's representing a dictionary. You know, it's a dictionary because it starts with a curly bracket. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, I understand it now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAwesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's what we're going to do. So we're going to say, hey, this column, metadata, we're going to apply something. We're going to apply a function and this is one thing that you'll learn. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI hate lambda functions. I never understood lambda functions ever. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThey're tricky. They're tricky. You got to find the right places to use them. And when you're trying to modify columns on a data frame or add new columns in a data frame is the perfect time for lambda functions. So we're going to say, hey, this is just going to be a string and we're going to make it like it's a dictionary. And we're going to say, this is just name. Part of the metadata is just name. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe're going to say, don't you need. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThe curly brackets outside of the quotes? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDo you need. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. Like in the other one. Like that? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInside. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThe curly brackets on the outside. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I think you're right. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe're going to do name this and. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe'Re going to say, hey, this represents a dictionary. Yes. Maybe there's a reason why I do it this way, but I'll show you in a second. And then we're going to add, hey, string. We'll see how we make it this work, because right now this is a dictionary. We would be inserting a dictionary in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSee if this works. We'll see what happens. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd then name equals name in the metadata. Okay. Yeah, that makes more sense and makes me understand why they want it as a dictionary, because I was just like, why would they want it as a dictionary? But now it makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. We're just going to modify the previous. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThing, which is not good practice, because now I'm going back in the code and changing it to something else. So this didn't work. I think the reason why is because this is a string, but now we're making a dictionary, and that's why these string quotes are there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat we need to do is make this into something. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is so ugly, dude. But I think it's just the way. We got to go. Ignore this, please. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is not it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHey, this is. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh, you're adding the quotes. You need to add a double quote. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, I added this wrong. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh, God. Ad did not contain a loop with signature matching type. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhy is it coming out as an integer? Unsigned nine and string. And this metadata. Oh, of course. I'm just asking for this column to be modified. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCan you put a comment next to it and just say what it's doing? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's a tough request. Henry. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIs your code. You should be able to. Yeah, or say the role. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nJust say the role. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe're going to say that. Modifying metadata column by adding dictator. Yeah. Yeah. Did you not know that? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat must be, like, an american thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMan, get on with the times, Henry. Tookie and Tookie for everything. Now, when we run this, we get name Tomasibara. And when we pass it through a literal. And this is why we comment out lines of code and we don't delete. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBecause we might need it later. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo meta is going to be the row. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd then you want to change the fifth line of that function as well? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, I do. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet's see if this works. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I'm going to put it at 100. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo when it goes to 100, we. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCan just upload it like that. No, it wasn't written like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nValid type requires value. Type require value to be string. And pass type was an Int. Oh, that's fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe can fix that. We can fix that. We can fix that. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou said ID, but it should be index. Or is it just. No, it's called ID. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, well, we call it ID here just because that's how it was. But we called it index in the data frame. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nGot it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt comes out as index by default when you reset index. So let find more about this. I want to make sure it comes out of a string. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nRight level. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll right, that's for multidimensional indexes. You don't need to worry about that. Using the given string rename column, which. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nContains the index data. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCan you not just do index two string? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's a great question. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, guys, thanks for now. Was nice to meet you. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSee you'll be nice to meet you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's see. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCan I do reset index? Let's find out if I can do that. The apply. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWait, are you touching your computer or am I tripping? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI'm not touching anything weird. Oh, you've gone into, like, pointer mode. You're, like, drawing on the zoom, I think. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWant to reset? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, I can't see your zoom controls. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCan you try to let me stop sharing screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, cool. Let's go back at it. Nice. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is another way to call columns. Instead of the brackets, you dot. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo we're going to put that in there. Okay, cool. So this should work because the column. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIs called index and we say, hey, DF. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nType. Yeah, hope that works. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDid I. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat? No. Oh, what did I change? What did I do? Okay, there we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAfter DF, reset. Index. How can I make the. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNew index column? Sure, bruh. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd you ready? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt worked. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Vector count 100. You're on me, by the way. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh, okay. Sorry. Yeah, here we go. Yeah, we just need to query it now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I'll let you run with it, dude. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAlso, I was thinking this could be an easy YouTube video as well, of just going. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDamn right it can. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBecause what I could do is I could combine this with some of this stuff, like the images, and just do loom going through the notebook, dude. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOne piece of advice is start from the end. Like, hey, we uploaded 100 vectors of this data, and the step previous to that was having the metadata, having the IDs, having the values. How did we get those? This is what we did. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that's one way to do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, it only cost me 15 p of my credits. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, yeah, this was only 100 out of 23,000. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, that was before I did this, actually. I think that was just for the creating another. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo I'm curious. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, we spent one p today. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nStorage. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, I'm going to go now. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nEnjoy. I'm sorry. I know. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's fine. This is fun. Try some retrieval and see what happens. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, man. Peace out. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTake care, brother. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYep. Bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-02-28 Dev Meeting - Half Revised Outreach System Flow, Icebreakers, Half RAG with Henrycleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nTo allow her to integrate her movement email with the system, she's using the system to manage her activities. She emphasized the need for system automation to free up her time for interactions with real estate agents and clients. For client retention and loyalty, she aims for monthly touchpoints with every realtor and quarterly gift distributions. They use a company for assembling gifts based on triggers from their CRM database.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe system also supports sending out thank you notes and handwritten cards through another service, but it's not integrated into their primary system.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRealtors typically associate with an agency, and mortgage lenders with a financial company, but beyond that, they operate independently, sourcing leads often from realtors. Therefore, maintaining positive relationships with realtors is crucial for business.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe goal is to set up action plans in their CRM for each client or person, categorized by their role or process stage, to trigger external actions like sending gifts, thank you messages, or scheduling appointments through API calls. She highlighted that some professionals still rely on outdated tools like Excel instead of CRMs.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nConsultation services could modernize their systems, transferring data from Excel and categorizing it, alongside setting up automations. This process, once initially established, becomes significantly quicker and more efficient with each subsequent setup.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe iterative process of setup and testing allows for refinement and improvements.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBuilding integrations and identifying services for desired functionalities is the next step. This includes setting up text to calendar services and CRM automations, with a focus on delivering tangible products to enhance client engagement. Offering initial integrations for free benefits from potential referrals and leads to further opportunities for continuous services on a retainer basis.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMentions personal connections involved in the business, including his cousin struggling with outsourced services like social media and data organization. A meeting is scheduled to discuss data organization and marketing strategies.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nEmphasizes learning from existing manual processes to improve and automate them, enhancing efficiency and productivity.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDiscusses the age and technology adoption rates of his cousin and aunt, indicating different needs and approaches required for each.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHighlights the importance of identifying individuals' willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies, ensuring efforts are directed towards clients receptive to modernization and efficiency.\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIf you don't have a CRM, it's causality. If you don't have a CRM, you just don't make it that big. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I did a little bit of reading between the lines, and Paige, correct me if I'm far off here, but from what I know and what I've asked people about in real estate, there's usually about 5% commission on any given sale. So at 5 million, that's kind of roughly two hundred and fifty K a year. Now, do you mean annual basis or do you mean over their real estate career? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, annual. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo this would be. I think the 5 million is not their take home, but the 5 million in sales. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo if you're doing the 5% of that, which is their commission, and then that's only revenue. You have to think about how much the company takes, who they work with. Do they have the leverage in the relationships with 13 other people in the real estate process, or do the other 13 people have the leverage over them? So then you start cutting. So at 5 million, they're making at least six figures for sure. Around six figures. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMy thought process was trying to again, kind of narrow down target demographic. Where is an income level of someone that we might be talking to? And that's kind of what I was thinking about. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, definitely some other issues, compliance, because they're all part of another company, then they don't really want that data going, disappearing into somewhere else. I know how to fix that, which is fine tuning a chatbt model. However, what that doesn't fix is the engineers inside of the company seeing, hey, from our agent's computer, there's text being sent to OpenAI Chagibt. Oh, there's a hundred messages or a thousand messages to chat GPT, what's going on there? And it might be out of compliance. Even if the data is secure, even if OpenAI can never really see or train on that data, which is obviously the big, there's so much data about customers in there. So what do you do with that? Yeah, there's two solutions to that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe easy one is fine tuning a model, the hard one, but most compliant, is creating and installing a model ourselves. But that goes over $10,000 in price. It's what we want to do. That's the long term we need to build reputation. Anyway, we have the people to build it to. Unfortunately, none. He knows people. Anyway, he texted me back in France. Oh, local models chat GPT, but in your computer, which is fully compliant with any privacy because it never sends any data. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat. So a third thing that can be in tandem with those two options is kind of take inspiration from Henry, honestly, which is trying to climb the ladder as soon as possible. So when we get in, do we have the ability to then maybe after a few months have a conversation with someone up the ladder to say, hey, this worked really well for one of your agents or one of your brokers, would you be willing to do a small scale trial at whatever, 100% at the time? And then we have an agreement, a documented legal agreement that says, hey, this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIs what we're doing, we can do. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt on a larger scale with you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nObviously, I think that's the goal, but. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThen that gives us higher credibility to go to other brands and say, hey, this is what we did for Barry Jenkins or Aston or whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. And it is compliance hell in there. She's been trying to fight. She's the top of her ladder, of the mortgage lending ladder, and she's like going through hell trying just to connect emails with follow up Boss. Just to connect her emails to follow up boss, which I don't think they're going to approve because follow up boss just got bought by Zillow. But she did say, hey, if they don't approve this, we might be ready to walk out. That's how much they like follow up. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nShe has the leverage. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShe does have the leverage. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThey paid her and my aunt pretty sizable signing bonuses for them to switch mortgage companies like shut the fuck up within the last six months. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is all, this is new? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nShe's working for a brand new company and they've been trying to poach the two of them for a little while. So she does have, so she has leverage and her mom, my aunt is the branch leader or whatever in Annapolis, Baltimore, whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nInteresting. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt is, it is a bigger movement. I think it's based actually in Charlote. So it is a bit corporate in that way. It's not just them. They have branches at least around the east coast. I don't know how far it extends, but. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nShe said otherwise. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe company uses Salesforce, which she doesn't want to use because she doesn't want Salesforce having her data. And she's like, for what we use it for, it's too much. You're not needing to switch between large accounts, right. It's clients, it's realtors. It's like having the automations and she's like, yeah, if they tell me no, then me and my mom will go somewhere else. So they have the pool to do something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGood. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhat's interesting to me is that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I don't mean this in a negative. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWay, but it does kind of feel like you just described what could be a ceiling. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh yeah. It feels like a ceiling to me. With anything we move forward with, let's assume that is not where we're headed, where we're not convincing. This probably multibillion dollar in revenue mortgage lending company that we have the solutions to all the problems because they wouldn't pass anything that I don't think she's going to even going to get approved to follow a boss. But we'll see anything anyway as we move forward. We're thinking of networks of people, not companies. Fortunately, as a real estate agent you can make a lot of money. So even through individual people being part of agencies, there is money to be made. I. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nInto a firm and I just went and got my real estate license. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd is making a ton of money. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'm definitely going to reach out to him in the next few weeks once. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou guys start to get. Once we have a demo or two. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nExactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Great idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh, let's go. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Oh, my God. He was connected to everyone. Dude, this guy that we met in college who is killing it in real estate in New York City. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, yo, that's awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt couldn't hear that. Computers on the other side of the room. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, connections at our reach. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat's cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, we need to start setting up emails for. Finish developing our ICP and start sending emails. It has to be simple, it has to be straightforward. Everything that you said about your emails is great. Sort to the point, here's the offer, yes or no, and narrow it down as much as possible through that narrowing down. And you multiply that by, say, 200, 300,000 emails. We're going to find our customers. But I keep finding out that the more general the email reads, the less people will identify with it. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI added a fourth lead sequence. I added the fourth d sequence. Analytics. Look, okay, no replies on the. My open rate is pretty close to what your data is, 2% compared to zero for the other. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, because you added a link. Okay, was that for a follow up email or for the initial email? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI believe that was an initial email, yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe actually cannot do that. That is how emails end up in spam when it's not only text. Okay. And I wanted to let the campaign finish and then see what the result of that was to see about how bad the other spam rate ended up being. Wouldn't be bound. It would be. But would we know if it. Yeah, we don't want to do that actually. But you got a 2% click rate. That's really good to know. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, it's something. Every campaign is different, so when we look at the data, we'll really know. But this email has only been sent 100 times. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI saw that. I saw that. So you're looking at the emails right now? Yeah. Okay, I'm jumping in there. There are a couple of notes. Can we turn that one off and create a new one which is the same, but every word is the same but without a link. And I want to test that one. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo you want me to ABCD, you want an e or do you want me to just pull the links? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, E. That is the same as D. We turn off d just so the analytics don't get messed up. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI see what you're saying. Yes, I got you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. Well, as of right now, there's a clear loser on open rate, which is the first email with a fucking. What was it? Sequences. I can't believe I'm doing this. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI. Yeah, I hope that he takes as a learning opportunity. I'm going to be honest, the few interactions that I've had with Jorg, both via text and over video, it's a bit. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-02-29 Outreach Strategy with Zachcleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 3\\nWe are incorporated in the US for now and at some point somewhere else. We're a Delaware LLC. We also opened a bank account so we can start actually charging for our work. Yesterday we got together with Paige and one of her cousins, and they do real estate. They do mortgage lending, specifically at the beginning and at the end of the real estate process of buying a home. That's where they come in, and we had a great meeting going over everything they want to implement. As of right now, more ideas will come. The initial deal, and we'll get this drafted up so we can all sign it. Actual legal document. We're going to start with two minor automations. Major to them, minor to programmers. They're simple enough. We just have to find the right services for it and try them out on our own and by next Wednesday, have something to share with them.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIs it a paid opportunity?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is going to become a paid opportunity. These first couple of automations, man, the amount of referrals that are going to come through this one person is pretty absurd. It works pretty symbiotically where she wants her team to be more productive. This is not a real estate agent versus real estate agent. It's more of if everybody's more productive, everybody wins, which is great. The first couple of automations we're doing for free, they're simple enough. We're expecting referrals. And the third automation onward, we are charging for retainer and per project.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nProject number one, very straightforward text message. Make a calendar event. Hey, let's meet tomorrow at 03:00 p.m. At the cafe. Bam. This gets triggered. Google calendar event gets created. They use text messages like SMS. A text message would also in some cases, in most cases that Google calendar even needs to get created. Also, a task in their CRM would also need to happen. Their CRM is called follow up boss. We're going to sort of try it out and try it out for ourselves. We have a bunch of lead lists, so we're going to do that process ourselves, get familiarized with the platform, and essentially start doing the thing that they want to do for ourselves.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nDo we have logins to their follow up boss?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe're going to create an account ourselves. We will get access, just not today. If you guys feel like that's something that we need to have by Monday to actually do the process right, I'm happy to ask. And we can go from there.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is a free client with huge potential. So whatever investment needs to get done, be it time or money, I'm pretty sure that you can create an account and follow a boss for free. For example, when it comes to analysis, they know what they want. So when it comes to analysis, yes, let's make sure we can dive deep. But we barely understand the real estate process at this point.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI looked into the follow up boss API and it looks great, man. It looks very well documented. You can do anything and everything. We're getting very lucky with this. They want to do the same thing for emails, but not yet because their company, their big agency, needs to approve the integration of sending emails somewhere else. So this is on standby for emails. This is a go for text messages. Moving on. Action plans. So within follow up boss, action plans will not only be emails in their business and how they are running their business. Physical things are a big way that they show appreciation. So some small gifts, like call it a fruit basket or a small bottle of champagne for closing a deal, for example.Speaker 3\\nAn action plan would automate who needs to receive the thank you email for coming and what happens after, and they would automatically be set into that flow. So classic CRM stuff, as we say. Hey, these 30 people came, these 30 new leads came to the open house. We would also tag them. And again, the API allows you to do all of this. We would tag them with open House February so they can keep track of it. And also we can keep track of it programmatically. This is one of the big things they want to do with follow up boss, is action plans. And then there's something that we are going to do that a lot of future referrals are going to want and need because a lot of her realtors that she's connected to don't even use a CRM. And she explained two statistics. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNumber one, realtors start, say, branching out into hiring people and would be interested or actually can afford outside services once they hit about $5 million in sales. It's a random figure right now, so don't worry about the actual 5 million. However, it is also causality that if you're not using a CRM, being successful as a real estate agent is very hard. So this migration allows for real estate agents who are still managing their leads and spreadsheets to unlock one of the tools that will help them become successful in that business. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo this is hardly for future uses, for future clients, for future referrals. However, this is a great first step for us to get very familiar with the API and with the actual CRM. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I think what's interesting about the CRMs compared to spreadsheets is one to the client, it might not look much, but the capabilities it would give us or them. For example, just triggering stuff off a CRM instead of like having. You're not going to trigger stuff off a spreadsheet, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, good point. You have a ceiling of what you can do. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThose are the three main things, three main flows let's call them. However, we talked for like 2 hours in chunk so this is all the notes we took, all the different things they wanted to do. I'm going to very quickly go over them and then we're going to move on. I want us to look at the API and just answer any questions that you guys have. So text and emails trigger a calendar event with a reminder. Let's look into reminder later. Follow above. Action plans automations task person with a certain task, meaning create task for person with certain tasks. This may not only be one person, this could be their social media manager, this could be their email marketer. So create a task for this person. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWith a certain task. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThen there's follow ups and touch bases. We talked about gifts, sometimes they send something and they have a service for this. So us triggering an automation where it's like hey, once a quarter. So start of the quarter, the automation sends an email to the gift company with details of all people to send gifts to. Just going to move on. This is not what is important right now. I just want you guys to see all that we talked about and all the ideas that this person gave us that they want to implement. Handwritten card, that's another service that they use. They want it to be triggered automatically so they don't actually have to go to the website and say hey, it's this person and this is the email and that's the email and this is the card, whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo automate this. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd then things like further realtors meeting up once a quarter. For example, hey let's have lunch next week. And that's a simple text, very simple things that we can do. Migration to follow up boss will move leads from spreadsheets to follow up boss. Social media automations. The main one is integrations to be able to post once and post everywhere. Obviously if it's a video or if it's a text, post might not go to TikTok, right? But essentially post once, post everywhere relative. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo the type of post. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd then there are some future ones. This is where the retainer comes in. She has expressed a lot of desire to implement different AI tools that help with productivity. For example, Opus pro grabs a video and creates a bunch of shorts out of it. I see Henry smiling. Yeah, we've been trying it for some of our meetings the last few days. We actually bought the full subscription and man it's fucking sick. It's so good. And we showed it to her and she's like, yes, this is something that I want. Can you do this for me? It's like, sure, we can do this for you. This is not really what we do. But their social media person doesn't know this tool. So when we're talking retainer, this actually has a purpose, which is new tools are coming out. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHow can we help you improve your productivity consistently over time? And that's what the retainer is for. Sometimes it was fuzzy to me, like, hey, why are you charging a retainer for a chat bot? Sure, maintenance and stuff. But does that mean the chatbot is going to break at any point? It might. Okay, so it feels like you're telling me you're selling me this great thing, but then that it's going to break. And the value of the retainer was fuzzy. To me. This feels like great value to help their business continue to grow. And social media is huge in real estate. And then again, post retainer, create posts with my style, with canva, this is kind of what she. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGoes to, the retainer feasibility. You can also say, and it's the truth, is the shabbo going to break? Yeah, it can. Because every time open AIMX update prompts that you written before might not work again and prompts written six months ago will probably not work as good as the day of writing it. So, yeah, you can communicate to the clients like this every time open MX update, everything change, basically. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. My problem with that is the perceived value goes down if they're constantly thinking. So I think that's just a gray area to avoid. But to go down the route of, we'll continuously look out for new tools and be trying to implement. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, but you're not saying it will break and you actually washing hands because you're putting it all on OpenAI and you teach them that this technology looks like this is a big player that gives us all the capabilities in here, and every time they make an update, things might break and it's just the way it is and just frame it as an educational value rather than you explaining yourself. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I agree. But I also think there's kind of an edge to them not knowing and us being getting them on educating that much would take a lot of time. I don't know. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWell, they're definitely early adopters also, they think they're first to finding about AI tools and it's been a year and a half. We are so well positioned. It's ridiculous how well positioned we are that they think they're first. So I love the intellectual debate of retainer and how to show the value and kind of washing your hands because yes, it is not our fault, but we can fix it. So that's going to come up inevitably, maybe not with this client, but in the future. So thank you for your input bartek, knowing that there are things outside of us that are changing and you need someone very qualified to be able to adapt to the change. So your chat bar keeps improving, not deteriorating over time. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMoving on. Email automations. This is for the near medium future because they now depend on a corporation to approve having their emails being read by an outside service. And there's sensitive information like where do I live? I'm looking to buy this house. This is how much money I have, this is how much I got approved for very sensitive information. So we need to treat it carefully, but for the simpler stuff that doesn't really require us taking information out of their email, but us putting information in is newsletters. Right now she has newsletters that are done mostly manually, but they don't even have the name personalization. It's just a newsletter that goes out to everybody. So at the very least we can help with that and we're going to be able to help with other stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut we didn't really dig into what the perfect newsletter would be. But would this relate to a CRM automation of knowing who to send the newsletter to? How can we help improve CTA for the reading the email to actually leave somewhere or ask for feedback from the newsletter? Hey, what would you like to know about the state of real estate this year? I said state a lot of times, so this is for later. But newsletters is one thing that they're interested in. And then comes the bigger conversation of privacy for the future. Let's say the corporation does approve the use case of having the emails being read by AnSa service. That's not going to look like, yeah, just send them to OpenAI and they can train with those emails because there is private sensitive data in there. So how do we ensure privacy? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOne way is actually going through the fine tuning process that OpenAI has available where anything that gets trained or any I believe I have to confirm this, but any inputs or outputs are not used so are not trained on. I have to confirm that. However, today and always local models will be the big privacy thing running on our server. Running on their server, whatever. But local models would be the winner here. We're talking about a much higher price tag here. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause I'm assuming it's like a big corporation, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt's a big corporation. And they are a smaller company within that corporation. I'm not sure what the exact business legal relationship is, but yes, they work inside of this corporation. They probably pay fees or whatever. And what this corporation allows them to do is sign the mortgages because it's not coming out of these people bank accounts when they're like, yeah, you're approved for $500,000 home. It's not their bank account that it comes out of, it's the bigger corporation that is sort of under signing that approval for a loan. All right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause I'm thinking like corporation most of the time are standing on the Microsoft. So we could try to make an azure instance of GPT four. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat's a wonderful idea. We already have Azure set up. Let's look into that. I don't think that's the priority, but yes, let's definitely look into it because sooner or later we need to know what the fuck we're talking about. Okay, wonderful. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDo they do, I mean the mortgage probably don't do that because I have this automation for generating the real estate listing like description stuff. They're doing something like this or not? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat's a great question. Great observation too. The mortgage lenders, no, but they have about 40 real estate agents in the team and those agents would want to do that. And most of the agents are not going to overlap in districts. So within, at least in the US, a city is not really a city, it's a collection of districts. So there is the center of the city and you might call the whole collection of districts the same name as San Francisco, but there's a lot of districts around. Real estate agents essentially belong to a district, to a certain district. So most of these real estate agents don't overlap, are not in competition with each other, which is wonderful. And when it comes to, hey, we came up with this service for creating great listings, listing descriptions. Here it is. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThis is how much it costs and they can all use it. This is how much it costs per. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nUser, for example, or also automate the content generation. Similar way also to the real estate realtors, basically because we've been doing one realtor in the beginning and we already have this priority map and we have few ideas for things in there. So maybe we can touch on that later on. We have call with Pavo, he probably wants to bring that up. And I actually have to bounce because we have the next meeting about an hour, so I'll have to bounce off and then we can continue this conversation on another call later. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. Do you have to leave right now? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLike five minutes. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, five minutes is great. I just want to go over this real quickly and see if any of you have used any of these services before or programmed with any of these services before. Tulio. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, some knowledge. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGreat. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBartek, you said yes or no. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe've been playing around a little bit with make, but nothing serious. It's more of like dummy project. I don't know. But you remember doing something with Tulio or it was Camille doing that. Once again, you remember early projects with make? We've been doing you and Camille and then one of you. I don't remember which one was doing something with Twilio, but I don't think we have the. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt was. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTwilio. Twilio is more SMS. But the main thing is the regulations with SMS that you'll want to regulate. I'll need a read up on the US stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nUS tends to be lax with those. Yeah, yeah, I know. In other countries has issues. Okay, moving on. Open phone. If it sounds familiar to that, I will get the name of this and probably not, but we'll just need to connect to it or send an email. Opus pro, anybody? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I've done my research on it. I think it's pretty easy. Yeah, I've heard about it and. Well, I found it and stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes. This is more of an automation. This is more cataloging. Who's familiar? Zapier. Who has done at least two automations with Zapier. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe are make fanboys. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBartech, Hubie. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI prefer make as well. It tends to be cheaper. It's only certain things you want to use Zapier over make for. If it's the Apia might connect with follow up. Better than make. That's the only reason I choose. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nGreat. That is really good information. Okay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nZapier if necessary. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLovely. And then connecting to text messages will be. Yeah, we'll figure that out. Probably that kind of Twilly. So we have to look into. Okay, let me ask that question with Tulio. Am I able to read messages or just send. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, because you can read the messages. I'd have to check. I think you can use the API so that you can send the incoming message somewhere. So that then tells me, oh, you can read the message, if that makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, wonderful. So, Henry, if you can look those details into those details of Tulio, what's the use case? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSorry for reading. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, great question. So the use case is going to be this. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIs there a task to complete? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLet me simplify for now. Is there an appointment to set. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBooked? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. Okay. And how does it know whether to book one or not? Is it reading the message? And in the message it says, hey, we should catch up next week, and then it knows. Or is it. The AI is deciding it would be most valuable to connect up next week. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThe AI would not be deciding if it's valuable to connect. It will just read the messages. Lunch next week? Yes. Wednesday at 03:00 p.m. Add wherever. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGreat. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWednesday at 03:00 p.m. Add wherever would trigger now creating a calendar event. So we need a service that simply can read that message, and then we'll have. Honestly, in my mind comes an assistant. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat just reads the message. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWhat might have to happen is fuchsia. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nPrompting would probably be good enough, but we'll see. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I'm thinking we might have to redirect the messages to a new phone number and then have them read from there, if that makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, great. That sounds plausible. Let me write that down here. Redirect messages. Price, because she gets a lot of texts. So let's look into what the cost of that is and how if we would then include that into the price or the price of the retainer. Okay, so just if you can look at those two details regarding Tulio, would we need to redirect messages and what would the price range be for that? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay, you can add me to. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, that's right. Awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you, Kuba. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNow I'm going to look into follow up boss and look into adding a bunch of people, a bunch of leads inside of follow up boss so we can start doing things with it. One question. We also already kind of have two referrals, so that's good. One that needs to set up follow up boss and do the migration of leads. And one that already uses follow up boss and wants the next level, the automation. So. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThis is exciting, you guys. What questions can I answer before we part into Kuba wanted to look into icebreakers and such, but what questions can I answer right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think I don't have a question for now. I think we need to see the thing. So I was thinking we can also just send all messages through Twilio to make and then have just open AI call and filter from there. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, that would definitely be one effective approach. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut on the other side, if she's sending so much text messages that are not all of them is relevant, then we would have a lot of operations on make, which might be quite costly. I mean, not that much. You just need to probably have some higher grade of subscription. But we'll see how that goes later. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGreat. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's why I wanted to go into this in detail. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nShe might get rather than talking messages an hour for about 10 hours a day, it's about 100 messages a day. I would be surprised if it was less. Okay, we'll look into it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGood. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAwareness. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm thinking also about, for example, there could be a situation where she sends a message or two messages and AI basically have to read them two as a one thread to understand the context. For example, one message states a day and another message says the hour. So I'm thinking that could be a risk in there that just API calling makes will just read one message and be out of context. Kind of. I'm thinking mitigating that could be. And also mitigating the cost. Could be if she just. That will require some future automation. Because I was thinking if she can make screenshot and then we can set automation to send that to Gptvision, make she makes screenshot when she have the meeting in those texts. So we omitting all the not meeting. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nTexts that point we're looking at her pictures. And I don't think that. Let's keep the ideas going. Let's definitely keep the ideas going. If there's a way to compile last four messages, for example, from a certain person. So let's look into Tulio first, and then we'll go through branches of risks and solutions. Yeah, cool. So, Henry and Kuba, look into Tulio. I'll look into. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFollow up boss. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd for now, Kuba, let's keep going on the outreach. I'll stick around and we can talk about it. And Bartech, what does your time look like today and the next few days? I know we're talking in an hour, but what does your time look like today? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAlready fully booked till. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nTill. I meant like Monday and Tuesday more. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet me see that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI got some calls in Tuesday and Wednesday. Besides that, I'm quite free. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo we'll get to work on Monday on some of the details. And we can actually get a prototype probably just straight up Monday. So we have follow up boss. You guys, this is really cool. Yeah, I'm glad you find it cool. Paige and I are moving to the other side of the world tomorrow, so we'll be around on Monday for all the meetings and whatever. So fortunately, we're traveling through the weekend. However, were evaluating what times would work best for you because we won't have anybody in the Americas. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIn fact, I've got a last minute update as well, basically my dad's now got a job, but he's not starting until next month, so he wanted to go do something. So I'm actually flying to Thailand on Monday, dude. Which also means we're in the same time zone. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat's awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI think it's 4 hours difference between Singapore to Sydney. So that will work for us a lot better. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHow long are you staying in? How long are you traveling for? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nMaybe two and a half weeks. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, I got about. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI'll share some questions and we can figure out probably some better times that work for people, but anyway, we'll figure that out. That part out. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt also does mean I'm probably going to be, I will make it, I will bring my laptop and I will work, but I will probably be about a bit and then. Yeah, today is really my last day to work on this before Wednesday, probably. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGreat. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo let's. Okay, we'll come back to that in a second. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHenry. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nKuba. How you doing, my brother? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nGreat, man. How are you doing, bro? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, as you can see, I'm doing fantastic. Curious, what's the update on the relevance integration into the script? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, it works. Currently the project is going in another direction. So I figure out that landgraph would be like the best right now. So we need to recreate everything with long graph because we need like a router. Because when a query comes in, we need like an LLM as a router for the question so it can direct the question to the right agent. Do you understand what I'm trying to say? Yeah, it can work in a loop. So that's what I'm trying to figure out at the moment. I tried out the relevance API and it works well. But the only problem right now is the email prompt. It is like taking too much of token credit. The course is very high when I tried the prompt template, so I need to address that first. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, so you're talking about. Okay, let me share screen and you can show me which portion you're talking about. Okay, you mean for like email draft? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBreakers. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd then. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nHere those prompt templates. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nDo you use Langsmith? I have not. Longsmith is just like for debugging and checking token cost. So when I checked, this is costing like about almost a dollar. So we need to refine the prompt to make it better. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWait, so only this is costing a dollar is what you're saying? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, almost a dollar. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIs that with the output as well? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. This is for last month. Can you just show me last month please? Show me last month. There we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo these were like four or five runs of that event, of that script is what you're saying? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nCan you go to Langsmith? Just log into longsmith. I'm using my API. I need to share my screen. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGive me a minute. Okay? Yeah, man, this is cool. Okay, click message it. Nice. Kuba's training from his computer. That's cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nCan I give access to share my screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere you go. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI see my screen now. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNo, not yet. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's loading. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo this is what I'm talking about. So, so I can see the agents that, I can see all my workflow here. So for that draft and email, see the crust of the token? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\n32,000 tokens from what? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSometimes I guess it's just the agents misbehaving sometimes spin off. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCan you see what percent of the tokens are the output? What percent of the tokens are the. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nPrompt? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWell, we have the prompt, so. Oh, but it has like the question input and then the agent scratch pad and then the summarized. We're going to optimize the knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBecause that's not very effective. Oh, nice. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nLook. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThis is the output of the. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhere's the email though? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay, I'm sorry. This was like the question that you asked. So this is the amount of tokens for each of it. So for the email output, think it should be somewhere around here, not this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt. Okay, so. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nFor that one prompt, which is the number, is it the 1800 amount of tokens it consumed? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. Okay. When you are using an agent, it's breaking the tax step by step, from the beginning, from here. For me, this is the input, my inputs was dropped. An email using like a summarized version of our knowledge list. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThis is the output down here. Let me try to. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo 1300 tokens is what the input was. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd then the whole step by step of breaking down the action, input observation and running the step by step of the lang chain, then that in total was 32,000. Is that what we're saying here? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, that's what I mean. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nDoes that include like icebreakers and all that stuff? Or is this purely just that one step of drafting the email? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nJust the only step of using our summarized breakers that we created. Okay, so what we're using now is the prompt, the icebreaker, the output from the icebreakers and summarized version of our knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd what you're proposing for minimizing token usage is changing to land graph? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nLand graph is just like routing questions. When an impute is sent to an eleven. It's routed to the right agent. You don't need perform loop with the tools. You just need to just give it the input. It knows the tools that it's going to use because of reasoning. Got you. So long. Graph is just a better way to run agents. Like making it more autonomous. Something like thereabouts. We need to fix this prompt to be more effective and to minimize the cost of the tokens. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, we definitely do. Okay, school. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nIt's cool. I'm thinking of something. I'll try it out and get back to you. Just like giving you updates. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSounds good. I do really want us to prioritize making sure that. Well, let me just double check and backtrack a second. I'm looking at the icebreakers. We have five icebreakers. Professionally relevant, interest based adaptive communication style. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nTimely and relevant. Icebreaker. Suggestive of collaboration. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIcebreaker. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo the icebreaker seems to be writing not a whole email, but it is going for the congratulations on the release of whatever. It's an impressive and collaborative effort. Could you elaborate on how this data set could revolutionize PD learning and multimodal perception? We might want to start choosing a real estate agent to ask more relevant questions to what we're actually going to do. But could we set up a time. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo discuss this further? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, now comes the portion that we talked about. I'm going to share screen real quick. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHey, guys, I have to bounce now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, sounds good. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWe'll see you later, Huey. Now comes this portion of introducing the human. We have some icebreakers. We'll run it a few times with different people. We'll collect those icebreakers and then actually evaluate. So I'll get together with Zach and we can look at it. We can set up some time and actually go through a bunch of icebreakers. It feels to me that if we're going to do this in an organized, systematic manner, we're going to need airtable. So uploading these to the airtable base that we created so we can actually look at them one by one and have notes of what we would change. I'm thinking aloud here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHuman. Here. Upload icebreakers to airtable. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd we can have a table of icebreakers. And then we can fine tune starting from the icebreakers. The concern that you bring up for tokens is a super valid concern. And we have the options of changing the model. We also have the option of changing the prompt to make it smaller so that at every step that it gets processed, it's not consuming a multiplicative amount of tokens. That might come through. Optimizing the knowledge base first, kind of like creating the summary of the knowledge base first, because the knowledge base tells the whole story and we don't need the whole story, we just need like objectively, this is how we're involved. This is our offer, this is what we offer, and this is the ideal customer profile that we're going for. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo knowledge. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBase summary should only contain kind of like ICP. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOur offer. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd kind of ethos of the organization. Amplify the human and this could be just a whole summary. We might give it a little more, but let's start there. So we'll create a summary of the knowledge base and that will, number one, help with reducing token usage and not having the model have to go through so much information. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt will just confuse it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhat other thoughts come to mind? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo I'm thinking of refining the prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nEmail prompt. Thinking of refining it then. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd is that shortening? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI can't see shortening. I think creating it from the beginning, but I'm still going to be implementing some things from PFE from this one that we're using. Yeah, really like building it from scratch. So I'll try out a lot of iterations and see what works out well. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, sounds good. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI think I'm going to look at this icebreaker prompt and probably change a few things. Not much. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think this is pretty straightforward and effective. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWe just need to go test it with our actual ideal customer profile, real estate agents, and we're working on that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWith the sales team. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThere also came the other question of like, hey, what framework of email do we use? So we'll be integrating that as well. Maybe that's something that helps guide this a bit more of like, hey, here is the framework. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPrompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, Kuba, can we make sure that this gets uploaded to the GitHub? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWe can create a repository. I'll create a repository. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I didn't know they had this. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnyway, I'm getting distracted. So we have personalized outreach system. I'm adding you guys in here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBy going to security it settings collaborators rate, and we have. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nRate of for members. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCan you guys see if. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou can get here? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I'm in the GitHub. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWhere exactly you define? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh, just personalized outreach system, if you can see it. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd Kuba, you too. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOh, yes, I'm coming. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAwesome, awesome. So that's where we're going to update everything. So if you could start with this initial commit and then we'll go forward, there's definitely some to do. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nKuba, what's your GitHub username? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nKuba. K u b. Let me send my k u b. Oh really? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nJust simple, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUpload icebreakers to airtable. How do I invisible optimize email draft token usage? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, wait, I'm going to remove Ahmed because we only have four seats. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh, I see. Yep, yep. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, great. And deleted what I wrote. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHave you heard from Ahmed? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I did. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI also nan messaged me last night. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSaying he's fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo yeah, he just made it back to France. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHe messaged me too. Okay, awesome. Optimize token usage on email draft. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWait, can you drop your email address to the GitHub in the chat to your GitHub account? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n$30 for a million tokens. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo that's $0.03 for 1000 tokens for. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOutput, $0.01 for 1000 tokens. Okay, so yes, we definitely want to be using this. However, if we're talking GPT four. Oh, what? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nGPT four turbo. Oh bro, we got to be using GBD four turbo. Are we not like half the cost. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nA third of the cost, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd then 3.5 turbo. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, they're making them cheaper as well. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt's crazy, it's absurd sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nIt's in your chart. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYes, I found you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. So I'm just going to go update the model real quick. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI didn't realize you weren't using the turbo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI would have said something, sorry, but we found out now and that's what's important. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAll right, I sent you an invitation, it might be in your email. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd this is the organization called fasterized GitHub. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Cool. So GPT four preview. Preview. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nKuba, if I run this whole thing, then you would be able to look at that same analysis of token cost. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSure. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI added you as like a collaborator. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, awesome. Yes. I'm going to connect and then run all it. Okay, let's see what happens. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo this will be slow. That's something that we'll have to work with. And it's fine because this is not time limited. Fortunately, as we prepare leads to send emails for a campaign, we have time to prepare them. Even just running it overnight is good enough. So don't be too concerned about that part and we will optimize over time. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nAll right, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd yeah, the other thing is LinkedIn profile URLs. Most of the time we'll have it. Not always. So it's great that you left that in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe'll keep using it. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, I was about to ask about that, I saw your comments about it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI didn't get what you're trying to say. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhich one? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThis one or this one about the LinkedIn URL? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh yeah. So for some of our lead lists, the LinkedIn URL will already be available. So this step where we're doing the serp for finding the. No, it's not Serp. Where we're doing the search of the LinkedIn URL. This step would need to be skipped because we already have the LinkedIn URL. So how does this flow change when we don't actually need to do this step? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSorry to close your. So this is where long graph comes in. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWe use like an LLm as like a router instead of like. Okay. In a case where we have only the LinkedIn URL, the LLM router knows that. Okay, it's not going to be directed to this agent. Instead we're going straight to this kind of, yeah, we're not meant to use this agent. Do you understand? Like the router agent, we're going to create routing for each question. So you know that. Okay, skipping this agent, we are going. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThe right agents that are useful. Do you understand? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes, I do. I understand. I guess my question is, as of right now and for the near future, the critic will be set in different places. Right here. There's another critic here, there's another critic here, and there's probably one loop that happens. However, it's mostly sequential. In fact, this loop is just a sequence where we put the email writer here and then the email gets sent. So since it's sequential and the LinkedIn profile, whether we have a LinkedIn profile or not is pretty binary, it comes from a variable. Would we really need a whole agent, a whole routing agent to decide what step comes next? Or can we just do, hey, if this variable is filled in this lead list, in this spreadsheet in the CSV, then do this step. If not, then do that step. Is there another purpose to the routing agent? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nNo, that works too. At least that works. It makes sense. Much easier. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIn my ideal view, what you said, yes, it applies. There's a critic that will, whatever, do an assessment of the icebreakers and then say, hey, you know what, let's go back to the icebreakers step because none of these are good. Ideally that's something that happens. For now, for a V one, let's keep it sequential, let's keep it code, and in a way minimizing the amount of agents that we're using even as we're using like ten different agents. Okay, so I'm with you on the application. Let's keep it simple for now. Let's keep it programmatic. And as soon as I can, I will give you a CSV of what that actually looks like, of what those leads actually look like, and when that LinkedIn profile column, that data is there or it's not. Yes, this is a LinkedIn URL or it's empty. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIf it's empty, then run this step. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, run this step. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo we'll get around to that. For now. What you're doing here is wonderful. And we will decide. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBefore next step. Check if the leads CSV contains a LinkedIn profile URL. If it doesn't, skip next step. If it does. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIf it does, make LinkedIn profile URL. Make LinkedIn profile URL equal to whatever data frame which has the same name. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLinkedIn profile URL. Okay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd as we're looping through the people in this data frame, in the CSV, we can actually play with the variables inside and all that stuff and we'll integrate the instantly API later. Yeah, anyway, I think we're on the same page about that. Anything else to note? Anything else I should look at here? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI think that should be all for now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I'm going to try running this one more time. Run after sample data. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd we are also not right now you're comfortable? If you're comfortable with Google Colab, that's great. Let's just make sure we have a version of it in the GitHub and we are going to transition to, unless you can have. Yeah, yeah. Save a copy to GitHub. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, great. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAs long as we're clicking on that. So good. Just can't see the organization here, which is weird. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI can't see faster ICE. Why not? Because it's not public. Is that why? Because it's not public. But I can see it here. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnyway, that's a me thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWe can move it to visual studio code or something. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMy point is, whatever you're comfortable coding is fine as long as we have an updated version of it in GitHub every time. And I can just be using visual studio that I feel comfortable with and I can be running it there so it works. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI just actually built it out using collaboration. I'll move it over to visual studio code, then I can just pull in from the repo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSounds good. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd just going to change the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nName too, just so we're same page, massive purse. Let me run the rest of this. Just want to have you here while I run this. Oh, I have another meeting. Okay, cool. Beautiful. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nVery readable recent posts. Great. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, it's still running. Okay. To assess Yannicku's relevance and potential alignment. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWith our company's strategic goals in the AI sector, his expertise, experience and interest. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAgainst the backdrop of our company AI. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSector, your role is carefully review information of the person. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAssess how significant person is in artificial intelligence. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, I'll work on tuning that prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nJust so it runs smoother, but it's good. And down here we put a step part of the to do list. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThen we talked about. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOptimized qualifier prompt. I also looked at uploading to airtable for human review. Sync with GitHub latest version accessible to everyone. Lovely. Okay, great. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThank you guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nChecking this, checking this. Ran scrape LinkedIn profile. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLinkedIn data. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nNo, that should be deleted. This is for like when I was using this proxy call. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes, that's right. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo I'm going to delete it. That's why I moved everything down. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. And then it finished. Okay, if you can just upload a version that includes this, maybe with a. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nComment. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI want us to have different available options. And this worked. It worked. So having that code somewhere in the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCode base is just going to be. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nA good idea overall. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThe email draft agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit. Do you know what that's about? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, that was when I was running the email. Do you just run this one now? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I just run it just now. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay, let me see it. I need to break down the email into a smaller section. Did you the input of the mail, did you run the email block? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay, scroll down please. Let me see. Just stopped you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nJohn Doe. Weird. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay, I have to go to a meeting. I'll leave you with that. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWhy is he writing John Doe? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nJohn Doe's a. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI don't know why that changed though. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhen would it have changed, John? It's the only time it shows up. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nUnless the LLM model automatically names it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, maybe if you can look into that on your side. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCuba? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, I'll check it out. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, great. Wonderful. Any questions that come up, clarification please hit me up and we can make. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSure we have it done. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut these are the to do. If there's any confusion at all, we can talk about it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCheck iteration limit. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nError on critic and check John Doe instead of Jan Lecoon. I believe it's on icebreakers. No, on email drive. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou guys, let's have a great rest of your day. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. Alejo, did you want to talk about the Thailand thing. I know you said something. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYes, I do. And I have a meeting with Bartek and Powell. Sorry for. Sorry that I kept you here. Let's talk about it later. Essentially, what I'm saying is, you're with your dad. Obviously enjoy your time. And as things speed up, we'll also make sure that we give you very specific, clear tasks. Okay. So you can organize yourself. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's it, then? That's fine. Yeah. No, I totally get it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThank you. Thanks for everything. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAppreciate it. Yeah, my pleasure. It's time to accelerate. Let's fucking do this. All right. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nPeace out, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nPaige, let's meet in a different link. I'll send it to you. Bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-01 Dev Meeting - New Client Projects, Real Estate, Google Calendar automation, Follow up boss automationcleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 2\\nYes, were in a place that looked like this doing a lot of work, but it was a mixture of a one day workshop for educators and youth workers. We also did training for facilitation. So like public speaking skills, learning how to deliver the curriculum, and then we had a five day youth program, all middle school students who were a handful. Really good program, really cool, a lot of work, a lot of energy, and full on, but very rewarding.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's interesting because I actually networked yesterday with a lady, that organizing event at the college in Warsaw, and they're basically looking for people that do AI and want to be speakers on such a thing. And it's directed actually to the high school graduates of this year that want to know interested in AI and want to basically find the path in the space.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou know, looking for doors like that, where we can step in and maybe there are people on site that can do it. But actually, one of the talks that Alejo did during the program was not specifically about AI, but about our relationship with technology. And it was woven together within theme of balance. So how do we find balance in our lives, especially with technology playing such a big role.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOtherwise, this particular program is aimed to be as technology free as we can to facilitate kind of a disruption in their lives of, okay, we're pause. We're going to be face to face with each other. But it would be super awesome to find sort of like a tech ed oriented foundation organization that would be able to donate either, like, chat GBT subscriptions or iPads or computers where we could host workshops on building a project with Chat GBT.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is that we're doing a deck for our clients is Pablo.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI got a hit of inspiration when we came back late at night, and I just started coding, man. It was impressive.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. I was thinking actually yesterday about using some of these code assistants to assist in writing prompts, but I was thinking, what if I would connect PFA to code assistant. And let's talk about what we have right now. So, circling back to the content and to the video, have you had time, Paige, to continue the editing?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI went through some trial and error with this video editing. A few different softwares. But I found this new tool called Opus Pro that I just dropped this video in. It's going to upload for about three minutes and we're going to see what kind of shorts it spits out. So it basically takes the large video file and make auto generate.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, I'm still working on this kind of mention form. It's going very slowly. I need to really focus on that. I cannot have any disruptions.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI've been trying before. I decided that, now the swarm is the only way to go. I was trying also to fix the UX of the version that is currently live.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo what are your thoughts on bringing PFA to market? How are you envisioning? What ideas do you have about how to productize it?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nActually, I've been thinking about giving a PFA light version, let's say PFA overseer, for example. The main idea was to give a PFA light version for free, or maybe some other version that would be like. Or maybe if we have the swarm. But the kind of swarm is tricky, because if we just give half of the process, it won't work so good.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe paid version would include the swarm, you would get limited access to the non-paid version that you could use and then upgrade to the full version, which would include the swarm.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOr I have also one idea, but that would be even more work because we could actually have the swarm, the GPT swarm for free, and then also build the same thing in code where it would be basically automatically going from one agent to another. But yeah, this is conceptualization, kind of, I'm not sure yet, but definitely we can try sort of circling back to my development process and let's say like the overseer version is the current version and just give it out for free and start the conversation going. And then on the back end, I was working on the PFA swarm in the meantime.Speaker 5\\nYeah. May I ask, did you maybe mention about also for the corporate world that we've been discussing about giving the PFA as a part of a bigger solution in terms of AI adoption? Have you been mentioning about it already? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe discussed that little bit along the PFA school, but yeah, we could bring that up again. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, it kind of came up after Alejo and I went to this workshop with people in the real estate industry as, hey, we could offer essentially a consultation, like a 90 minutes consultation. The number we put on it was 600. That would include we sit down with you one one, we build a chat GPT based flow or solution, which is not something that, it's something that they could do, but it just might take them hours to figure out how to do it. It would include access to PFA, maybe the PFA light version, maybe a three month subscription to the PFA, and then we would follow up, based on this consultation and the information that we've gathered from the meeting, and recommend two or three bigger system integration solutions that we see could benefit their business. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat would obviously be bigger paid solutions, because some of the outside of this bubble, number one, these people think they're first, they think they're the first people to know about AI and chat GPT, and they don't even have time to learn prompting. They don't have time for this. They're willing to pay people to help them. Some of them might like. A lot of people in real estate are more or less freelancers. They're going out, they're getting their own leads, they're associated with an agency, but their business is their responsibility. That's kind of a thought that we've had around PFA as a way to offer and get it out there. In sort of like an initial subscription. If people sign up for the consultation, and then the other kicker would be you pay the 600 or whatever number that might be for the consultation. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIf you choose and implement a larger scale project with us, then the $600 would go towards it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI personally love the idea and how you sell it. Not sure, but if you have anything to comment, just jump in, because I'm just on the verge of starting to chalk and chalk, because I feel so inspired now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIn that case, let me add a couple of things. Yeah, Paige got it just right. There's a plan for consultations. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm listening. I'm just letting the dog out, but I'm here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's a plan for consultations. I just wrote it in the chat. It includes access to PFA. That's obviously where a royalty obviously comes in. We're selling your products and part of the consultation fee goes your guys'way in. The 75, 90 minutes as we're sitting out with them is an audit. It's an AI audit. And part of it is like what we noticed is that they need something tangible. The people that are starting to get into AI are overwhelmed by, number one, the amount of tools that they're not even processing, what the tools are for, or how they could help their business. That's number one. And number two, no clear action plan for creating new tools. But does a real estate agent really need a clear action plan for how to create GPTs? They will tell you probably not. And the reality is they do. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut is that the first step? Well, with PFA, number three is actually creating two GPTs with them sitting down next to them. And it's like you write it, I'll just guide you with the how. And PFA is a great way to speed that up. I love it and I want to now transition to a different dimension of answering your question. If I heard correctly, PFA for corporate PFA as an instrument in, say, the corporate world, I very much still believe that PFA is something that you can sell at a very high price because of the extremely high value. That high price comes with the assumption that this productionized version works very reliably and that it goes through the complex process of itself. For example, the multi agent swarm, that it goes through those eight agents, and it just shows you the output. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt might take a while, of course, and that's obviously where the user testing comes in. So to answer your question, I think there's testing that needs to happen with the latest versions, not with the version from two months ago, because that's not the one that is valuable testing for. So finding key, influential people, giving access to the latest version of PFA, and not just the latest version, because it was the last one that was made, but an actual extremely effective one. And as effective as PFA is, the agents might be even more effective. So say whatever version you settle on is a good time spent, a good ROI, a good return on investment of the time you would have to spend for the next version. Make a decision on that and find those people and grant access. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut hey, we'll give you free access to this means nothing. Probably has negative value in the eyes of a corporate executive. So we have to find the way around. Maybe it's through an online conference, maybe it's through a webinar that we're selecting certain people so you can apply here. And whatever, it has to be strategic. It can't just be, hey, this is $2,000, but it also can't be like, hey, help us test this. There's a lot of value in this. There's a channel through which we show the value, for example, live webinar, and then we're selecting certain people to help them multiply their productivity. With this tool, you could be one of those. This is the characteristics of those people. Do you work for a corporation and are you an executive of the corporation? Whatever other requirements, then you're allowed to apply. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's how I would picture it. From there. It's up from there. As long as you get these influential people to use it, to test it, and then give you feedback, then you have a final version and you have the testimonies from corporate executives. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, sounds great. I'm not sure if I jump in with a couple of questions regarding your conversations with real estate, and then I will move to what you have already said. Okay, first of all, great to see you guys. Sorry that I had to be a little bit late. I really rushed to follow up to the prospect client. And actually, you see the name of the prospect client. Just to mention we are in kind of early talks with a huge game developer. They're called huge games. They are polish american company. They're mostly based in Poland, but also have offices in the US and some development teams in the US, in Israel, and a couple of different countries as well. Around 400 500 game developer employees. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd we are going to be checking whether are we a good partner for them, because they have already started and they have some vendors in their AI roadmap. So it's like I was a little bit surprised that they have signed off on some contracts already, but maybe there's still a room for us. But what we have been checking with them is what you see at this moment on the screen. And you have already saw for a moment, probably maybe once or twice, this diagram, and it perfectly aligns with what you have just presented, and we call it as a part of our AI adoption package. So the idea is that the employees, whether it's a corporate or maybe a mid sized company or whatever, the corporate people, the adoption, we see that the adoption is not huge. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd it's quite similar with, as you were referring to your people that you spoke in real estate, sometimes they just don't know where touch, how to start. They are not even thinking about prompt engineering on how to prompt. They just don't know. You have to get their hand and kind of guide them step by step. And this is the case with pre use. This huge games company, the huge games company have created a bot that they have integrated in their slack. Each employee has access to their slack and they have just built a slack bot that is connected to OpenAI APIs, to cloud, to some different language models. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut instead of getting the user experience that pure vanilla GPT gives you, that you have those four boxes with the example questions that you have some intro description of what you can ask by the GPT, what GPT does exactly. So the user experience actually is much poorer than you get from the typical pure vanilla GPT. Because I saw by a life example that an employee gets this phone gets to the slack, entered the slack bot, and he says me that I don't know what to do. The problem is, I don't know what I can ask. This guy actually is in HR. He works in the area called compensation benefits and he has like years of experience and he knows how to do his job. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd now he gets a tool that somebody said that hey, this will improve your work, but I know how to do my work and now I have to think. First I need to think like what I can get and how should I ask the question and what to ask about. So we need to guide them, take them by hand and guide them. And also were thinking about creating, or that's what were actually testing on those sales calls or intro calls that each of these employees going to have, or each department going to have the possibility to create those very specialized agents or assistants, we haven't decided yet how to call them for assisting with particular jobs. In this example that we already actually created for the edtech company in the US. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo it's maybe not exactly relevant, but very often you either work with kind of an assistant or a thought partner, sometimes called strategist role or a creator role. Know, for example, summarize me this text or create me content for my strategic deck for the meeting with the board. So this is the creator role. The thought partner is just to idealize and ask for feedback or critique. So those are three example roles. And then we ideated that on the end of this user path there is PFA. So whenever you can't work with the predefined by your department or predefined by your company, whenever the standard assistants that are out there are not good enough, you can create your own. And that aligns exactly with what you have just told me. Like what you visualize the possibility to use the PFA after your conversations. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nDid I got it right? I think that we have just both you with your market, with your conversations. We have already also been thinking and trying to get to the go to market strategy with PFA. I think that we are starting to align again. Did I got it right? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat a surprise. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt sounds like. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think a different dimension of the same thing that we're talking about. This is, I think a good visual example of the implementation, but it is complementary to the actual. Like how would we promote it, bring awareness to it? And this would be pretty complementary. This is something we would show at, for example, the live webinar. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I fully get it and I love the idea that you have just presented, let's say in live webinars. To expand on this idea, how to bring into those company, whether there's a real estate company or a different one, we would need to communicate openly in a similar way that I have just done it and address or maybe verify. Ask whether they have this problem that we often observe with our clients that the AI adoption is pretty low very often, and that this is the way that they might approach this. Assuming that they already are convinced that there is a sense to go with AI tools, that there is a sense that we don't need to convince them about the AI automation idea. In general, I assume that the business people are already aware of the possible benefits going with AI automation implementation. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt's just the thing that they are worried that they maybe have some already tools that are implemented or they are planning or they don't know how to do it to have this AI adoption on a pretty high level. So yeah, I think that we are onto something. I love it and I would love to ask you more about what hours have you got from those conversations? Not hours, but let's go deeper in terms of those real estate agents. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, let's step into that in a second. Paige, by any chance that video finished uploading? Yeah, man, I'll let Paige take it. But I want you guys to picture content to strengthen branding, which leads to invitation to a live virtual event. This is the first step content. And this is about PFA. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo let's see. I think I haven't gotten a chance to watch any of these yet. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFrom my standpoint, when I'm making a project now, I'm just brainstorming with PFA and at the end it gives me a prompt and it lasts, I don't know, 15 minutes or even less maybe sometimes. Depends on how much I want to iterate it, because best working with it is actually when you give some feedback and you should really know what you want to do. Like in the first iteration, you can just say whatever and then it will brainstorm, it will give you some ideas, but after the first prompt, you need to give it some thought. Maybe try running somewhere, make a GPT out of it and just try running and see what outputs are like basic testing of the prompt. And then you can, for example, do. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nKind of a couple of others. PFA example. Yeah, these are all created on the fly from one big video. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo let's see. Tips and tricks for success. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSometimes even I see still, I mean, this version is actually very good for my opinion, but sometimes it malfunctions a little bit because there is so many steps in it. There's actually like three distinct phases that need to be launched and then they have little steps inside and sometimes some parts get lost even though I make it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I can also update the size of the video frame to kind of match the platform that it's. A lot of people either have heard of it or maybe don't know what. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt is, and then AI is supposed to do something or produce something for you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat was an interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf you order, for example, if you want to search the web, you can do it with chat GPT, but it's. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nStill not the same. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI would recommend that Google searching infused with AI. So what would I use chat GPT for? What can chat GPT? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd with what you want to introduce today, you can just, can you pause for a second? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, editable number one, for sure. Number two, the core video has a lot to do with the output, of course. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is one good example of, let's say we record the next video, a simplified one say 15 minutes of a demo, and we show, and through those 15 minutes, we can publish the 15 minutes video, and we can create some good videos out of some good short, four or five shorts out of that longer video. So now we have five, six things to publish, five shorts that usually get a lot of use, and the longer video, which is, hey, if you're interested, here's the whole thing, and this is one. So through one video, 15 minutes, solid demo, planned demo. Maybe not necessarily a script, but pointers that we need touch on. We create a content schedule, probably for the whole week. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat that steps into after maybe two or three, maybe the other two are other demos, maybe it's quick tips and tricks, whatever it might be. We start generating the audience, and through that would lead to, hey, we're doing this live event. We tried Opus pro for one of our videos, and it was actually pretty solid. So I wonder what is the difference and what we can change about the core initial video that would make these results even better. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSorry, which one is the number one? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe should cut the beginning, definitely, because we started the actual video after I said, and then also after the kind of the part that's supposed to be recording. We also had a little conversation later, like 30 minutes. It's just our conversation at the end. So just cut that middle part where it's supposed to be the actual recording. And I think we will get much better results from that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh, we should do that one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, changing. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCutting the initial video, cutting the parts that don't belong from the initial video and then uploading. That's probably a good idea. But I guess what I'm saying is, let's record. I really like the video shorter. 15 minutes, for example. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGo straight into value, and it's like demo. Another thing that has come up a lot is show not tell. We can talk about PFA, or you can code that project in 15 minutes that you were just talking about. In 15 minutes or less. I can do the brainstorming and we can have the prompt, and then I have the GPT. I test the GPT, and that's the whole video, and that's 15 minutes. And we make shorts out of that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInteresting chats or any. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI was like, where did I come from? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I will examine that and maybe find a way to fix. Maybe I will send how to teach. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nEffectively without sacrificing sleep. Bartek's method reveal. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh my God, you're talking about. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou're talking about teaching two months from now without sleep. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou're not going to be able to. I slept 8 hours yesterday. I was talking pages in a row. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI love that this is documented. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI did. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. I think for this video in particular I could probably throw it. Well, I was just having. Maybe it'll export now to final cut pro. I can try to put it in fire cut to get all the silent spaces out because there are a bit of silent space as we kind of set up and transition. And then I can see what happens if I throw it in here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh, that's a great idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAt the very least these are all editable and much easier to edit in 52nd chunks versus the whole hour and however long this was. An hour and a half almost, I think. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut I think the actual content is like 50 minutes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo this one we could cut out the first part because it kind of switches topics and doesn't really flow, but. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nJust. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWas kind of good in the, how to say meritoric, kind of meritorious. How to say in English. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou mean the content? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThere's no direct translation for the word. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'll take that in Google. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat'S going to be published on fasterized channel. I'm thinking, are we able to craft kind of a targeting? How's it? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWell, can we optimize the targeting? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCan we optimize the targeting of the video? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThree factors. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nTargeting is harder. You can use some keywords in your description, in your video file title. There's some tricks. So the answer is yes. Can you target executives without paying for ads? The answer is no. However, you could pay for ads. Well, we could put this in LinkedIn and target with this video. The answer is yes, but it would cost to target. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe other thing you can do, every time when I upload the video, it processes the video and then I can click to generate the clips from it and it asks me a few prompting questions about what I'm using it for. So I can have that little bit of targeting in there. I don't know how pinpointing it is, but it does have that in here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh, that's wonderful. That's perfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. So I think I put like the target was education for this. We could try it again with a different target and it might craft the messages a little bit differently. As we're making the video, we can kind of outsmart the AI a little bit and saying, okay, every new topic that we are going for, let's talk about La so that it starts there or like kind of name the topic in our conversation as we go, knowing that it's going to extract that and be able to identify topics or themes that will then create these clips from. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, that's great work and great tips that you are giving us that you have come up with. I'm very excited. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nFor Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram, these reels are going to be perfectly lined. I'm thinking about LinkedIn as I haven't yet personally, I haven't seen anybody put anything like that on LinkedIn, so that would be quite of an experiment. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, for sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. We would need to check how it works. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut we're not posting a 15 minutes video. We're posting a 42nd video. And is LinkedIn not ready for 42nd reels? Is LinkedIn audience not wanting 42nd videos or has it just not been discovered or experimented with by the audience in LinkedIn? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, exactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll the metrics show that videos less than 1 minute are attractive to people, dense the information and show it to them visually and auditorially in 45 seconds. That's something that you want. So I feel good about maybe putting some of the LinkedIn credits that we have, say $100 in total. $100 in total of LinkedIn credits in preparation for the live event. For the live virtual event through these videos. Maybe there's some posts, maybe there's a graphic, but these could be, hey, we're doing an event for this and that. And that's the ad. And the ad also shows this video. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, there are a few. Yeah, I think there are a few editing things we could do to maybe make them look a little more linkedinish as well. Yeah, but people. Yeah, I don't know that it would be a negative thing to post on LinkedIn, but thing to beta test for sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLinkedIn users phone versus desktop, because if it's phone mobile, 58%, it's our game. Let's go. 58% are users on the phone and they're already used to the videos on the phone. The shorts. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, cool. Could you go to edit? Could you click on edit? I wonder what it actually allows you to edit. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, so you can. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh, let's fucking go. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, you can edit it in here. Change the layout for each scene manually. Just frame. Cool. Filler words and pauses. There we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'm so excited. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then you can turn the captions on or off. It's interesting. Now when you see this caption, to me, it's very. I've seen it before, everyone. It's like, oh, now I see. Now we know where people are making their shorts, but we can update it, right? We can make the captions different. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDid you click on fillers and pauses. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Remove filler words. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo it didn't do it automatically. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. And then the other thing that you can do is if I go, let's preset template, edit brand template, because I posted one of these on the faster eyes Instagram and I put it in canva to do this. But we can upload, like, we can put our colors in whatever colors, upload the logo so that it automatically puts the logo somewhere on the video. I don't have to take it out anywhere for it to do that. And then we can save the brand. So there's some preset templates here if I want to have my TikTok reels and shorts, landscape and then square. So I think I was telling you about these, Alejo, this is what I was talking about with just like, the frame sizing for different platforms. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt's even that square goes well with LinkedIn, as you can see. Yeah. And because of the coloring and the branding staff and the different layouts and styles, I think that we can make whenever we want to go with Instagram or YouTube shots, we can go with the standard thing that people are used to in terms of the styling of the fonts. But as you mentioned, LinkedIn, we could try to make a kind of a more grown up style, a little bit more professional looking and a little bit custom for LinkedIn platforms, for LinkedIn ish, as you mentioned. And that might work really great. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI really. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nExcited. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, it's simple. But even just knowing that you don't have the phone view if you're looking at LinkedIn on a web page makes it that much more meant to be there versus a real posted on. This is. I'm excited for this. And we've talked about doing weekly podcast hours with various members of faster eyes. Bring in syllabus, talk about what we're doing. Maybe there's an emergent theme going on in the AI community. Stop share because my screen is getting a little fuzzy, and then throw it all in here and start posting videos, sharing our story. We can get shorts out of it for longer podcast hours that go really well. And we have great conversations. Let's post them. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLet's go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I've been watching Gary Vee lately, and also there is a team going on that there is a Facebook actually trending for marketing for social media this year. Like Facebook is coming back. We need a fan page in there for both fasterizing celebrities and posting also on Facebook. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWell, bigger, because real estate agents are on Facebook and Instagram. Instagram is more for the business, but the age range of real estate agents are on Facebook, which is usually 35 and up. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. And also there is one more thing regarding the long form content we want to put out. Gary V actually said the best to just start streaming. Like, live streaming. Like, literally just sit at your desk when you want to work and just open the camera. Don't give a fuck that it's like three people watching. Just say like, hi, he'll make a joke out of it. You need to watch the conference to. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nKnow the full picture. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut basically he tell that just put out any content, just show you working. So we could even, maybe not all the calls, but when we have calls, development calls or something, or sales calls, just put that out. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLive stream, build in public. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's exactly what I was thinking about. Live stream, building public. Yo, yo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd actually, the best thing is we actually have the recordings already. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, we already have the fucking recordings. Which is a big question because we have so many recordings. Yeah, I found something tragic the other day, which is in most of the recordings, my face doesn't show up in like 90 something percent of all the recordings that we have. I just don't show up because of my Zoom settings, which is fine. And it's just more encouragement to level it up. Have like a day of the week where we get together on a certain project to build in public. For example, these couple of projects. Simple projects, but straightforward, but we have to find our way around it. We could totally be recording those, building them together in public, or at least designing them in public. And they're straightforward and we're not even really selling them. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut it does show how we think about these projects, how we design and how we implement, and that we can. And those could be live streams. Those could be live streams. Let's simplify, though. Let's. Let's simplify. And live stream is a good way to simplify because you're not editing, because you're just doing the thing and it's productive because you're actually doing the work. And you don't get much luxury to get distracted during a live stream because the show has to go on anyway. Real estate, thank you for all your input on this. This is going to be huge for our marketing strategy, which is mostly just solely based on video. So this is going to be huge. Thank you all. Thank you, Paige. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, thanks. A real estate. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe met up with Paige's cousin, a mortgage lender who has a pretty big team. Real estate is all about relationships and they are very well positioned in terms of their network. So let me throw you a summary and then we can dig into the details. As of yesterday, the status is what we want out of the start of this relationship is referrals. So we are building two simple automations for free. We are building a text to Google calendar appointment setter. This is not a chat bot, this is just, hey, the message says, let's meet at 03:00 p.m. At this place. And that would trigger creating Google calendar events. And number two is within their CRM, creating something called action plans, which is if there's a new prospect, do this and then do that. A sequence, a CRM, normal CRM sequence. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThose are the two things that we're implementing in the coming week. They're straightforward. The documentation of the CRM is very good. Anyway, that is not the summary. That isn't the nitty gritty. Sorry. So two automations for free. She's more than willing to give us referrals, but it's not that she agreed to give us referrals. It's not like we had to convince her that giving us referrals would be good for our business. So we can trade well, do a good trade with each other. It's that she wants us to implement these things. For who? For her network, for the real estate agents that she works with. Because if they're more productive, everybody makes more money. So we found a perfect first client. So even just these two first automations might be automations. We sell down the line to the referrals. What other points are important? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe're meeting up with her and her core team. There's four of them next week to dig deeper, and we're also bringing a plan. So on Monday we're meeting with advocates, on Tuesday we have a Gen XeC meeting and this is up to change. But Paige and I initially talked about what the times would be, and then Wednesday we would meet with her team to talk like, hey, this is the plan. And part of the advocates in Gen XEC is to figure out, okay, how do we solidify this, actually making a contract, bringing a contract, that's one thing for automations, past the second one, and we have a whole list that they want to implement. We're going to be charging per delivery and we're going to talk more about this during advocates in Genxec. We're going to charge per product delivered and a retainer. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe retainer and the value of the retainer is her intent of implementing AI in all different parts of her business, including social media, and she has a social media person, but that social media person doesn't know the tools they could use. So the retainer is more on the education side. It's more on the helping her whole team adapt to 2024 and making productivity out of every area of her business. So I'm going to show you something to make it a little more visual because words are very abstract, and ask us any questions you may have. These are the. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHow many employees? Sorry for interrupting. How many employees does she employ? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAbout 40. Is that right? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, she doesn't really employ. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. Right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOthers. What we've learned is that mortgage lenders need relationships with realtors because that's where they get a lot of leads for their business. It's her childhood best friend who is one of her main realtors that she partners with, who is like top real estate agent in Maryland as far as sales go. And she's already talking about how she wants to automate. She has a goal of having her system set up by 2024. Great. She knows a ton of people. She works with a ton of people, and she shared freely. Like, I've got people in line behind me who want this. They just don't quite know what they want yet. And I'm looking to surround myself with the right people to get this in place. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo whatever we do for her is a copy paste product for her mom, who does the same thing as she does mortgage lending and also probably copy paste for other lenders that work within her company that want the same automations. Of course there are going to be some fine tuning and tweaking, but we'll have the basic structure. And we very quickly facetimed her realtor friend when were meeting, and she was like, all right, I'm going to get this set up, and then you and I are going to talk and you're going to get it in. So it's not necessarily her employees, but a lot of her contacts and a lot of people she works with, realtors. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHer team, in a way. So her team are not her employees, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. Let's forget about the words employees might like. I wanted to ask about the team. 40 people, and all of those or most of those people are other mortgage lenders. So they basically real estate agents. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMost of those people. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBoth or real silver? Both. So some of them are real estate agents, some of them are lenders. Got you. All right. Yeah, that would be great. Before we get into those learning and kind of a workshops, because I'm already visualizing how to work on those workshops with those guys and what might be their workflows. My guess is that of course, both of them of those groups work with clients and they provide some kind of advisory, but with different products. One is helping to look around in the breadth of financial products with mortgages and other is helping to find to look around in the breadth of listings and real estate purchases. So those going to be probably, I would probably divide those two groups in the different workshops, but that's a conversation for future. I just wanted to understand what the task on hand. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThey use pretty much the same tools and they would need the same solutions. So a real estate agent as well as a mortgage lender needs to follow up with clients. And those follow ups take a lot of time. So they're both looking for follow ups, automations, it's along those lines. So although what they do is relatively different and well, very differentiable within the industry, the solutions that they're looking for are very similar. The problems that they have, the pain points that they have are very similar. So let me throw you a couple ideas that we didn't come up with. Well, partly came up with, but that she told us that she needs. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd it was really cool to start working with someone who has an idea, a vision of what she wants, just not the tools to implement it and the desire to find the right people to implement. So. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nFirst client, from my text messages, I receive a text message or I send a text message. Hey, lunch next week? Okay, great. Yeah, let's do 03:00 p.m. On Wednesday at X restaurant. From that message, there's a service. This is called open phone. It's one of the service. Tulio is a different service. For example, sorry to interrupt you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDo we have something except this, because I kind of heard it already and I'm just 12 hours already in, so. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIf we have something, if you need. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nTo take a break, go ahead, dude. Yeah, don't let me stop you. Bartech already saw all of this during the dev meeting. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll right, so let's catch up, I think, later. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, sounds good, brother. So from that text message, let's make a trigger. Well, it's natural language processing. Hey, is there an appointment here to set or not? Pretty much fusehot prompting anyway. And from that, connect your Google calendar to create an event. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. By the way, some time ago. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh, wonderful. We were actually looking for someone who had already, because were looking at which functionalities it's good at. But yeah, we can talk about that later. Number two, and not right now. But this is a second automation from the same branch from the text message to create a task in their CRM. Their CRM is called follow up boss. And to create a task, hey, we need, for example, details of the task pre approval for mortgage. And those are some of the most common messages that they get or tasks that they have to set. And sure, I'll look at it tomorrow. Tends to be the usual process. There's a request for an approval of a mortgage and then this person, page's cousin would look at it and then say, yeah, everything's okay, let's move forward. And she gave us a default. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nUsually I want an alarm at 09:00 a.m. That will tell me, hey, what is the task that I had to do. Great. And then I'll remember. So we'll leave this for later, for now. And this coming week, ideally before Wednesday, we'll have this text message to calendar event created. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. So this whole thing is, number one, I shaded emails because that's going to be a future thing. Her company needs to approve that. An outside service can read emails. There's a lot of sensitive data. So we'll keep it there for now. Text messages. Number two, action plans. Action plans are a series of tasks. So hey, pre approval for mortgage. What an action plan would be is if there is a new prospect, then step one is following up. And step two is pre approval. Whatever a person closes on a house, they bought it, mortgage got approved, and they will receive a gift, a physical gift. So we have to create a trigger to ask for a service that sends gifts to people, homes to send a gift. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAction plans based on who the person is, what kind of prospect, then do this action plan also follow up, boss. And those are the two things that we're going to implement in the coming days. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLet me double check. In terms of the action plan, are they asking for creating the action plans or they have their action plans already created and they want just to be automated? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's a great question. They have a lot of action plans and also if there's an open house event, hey, tomorrow we're looking at this house and everyone's invited to come check it out. We do a tour, people sign up so they have their emails and their name, and the next day this person wants to add them to their CRM. Well, what they can do is just upload the file and tag. These people came to the open house or in an automated way, it would be sending us the file and through code through the API. We say, hey, the tag is open house, and the action plan that they would belong to is people that went to an open house. And we just upload the contacts directly to her CRM. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd then the action plan triggers. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe action plan are essentially built in automations within follow up boss. And what's happened with my cousin is she recently moved mortgage companies, so she had follow up boss set up with all of her action plans and all of her client data in there. She was able to pull a lot of the data before she switched over, but now has to reset everything up. She's paying someone right now to put all of her data in here and clean up her. Like, right now, she's got 1300 client data with more to go. So the goal is that every client or every person has an action plan based on their tag, and they're tagged as, let's say these are some details we have to kind of work through with her, but they would be tagged as a realtor. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, if I'm tagged as a realtor, then I'll be on this action plan. Because she wants to have one email per month touch all of her realtors, and every quarter, she wants to send out gift baskets to all of her realtors. In that action plan, we'd be coming into the points where, okay, there's already the trigger that this is the end of Q one. Now we need to trigger this outside message to go to the company she's already working with to put together gift baskets and send out to the appropriate people. For someone who's looking at buying a home for the first time, they might be tagged as a first time home buyer and follow this action plan where she wants to ensure she has x amount of touches with this person and follow ups as they go through their journey. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThey get to settlement day. Settlement day hits, it triggers an automation that they get a handwritten celebration note and a bottle of champagne sent to there. And she's already got some of these puzzle pieces set up. Like, they have a service that puts together gift baskets for them. They have a service that sends out notes that are handwritten. It's just like connecting. Those would be the external integrations. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThe connecting would be our job, or she has already hired, because you mentioned that there is somebody that is working on. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, good question. So, can we automate the email that the gift service receives saying, hey, this is the person, this is their address, send them this. This is the person, this is the address. Send them this. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt sounds like a no brainer, to be honest, in terms of exactly this thing, the example that you mentioned, I'm just thinking around. My understanding now is that you've been asked to help in this figuring out that she has moved the companies and she wants to move also her breadth of the huge workflows or those action plans that she had set up and she moved to a different platform or a different instance of the software. Right. And now some kind of a mess. Somebody works to help her organize with this new system. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTo get to the next level. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd to get to the next level we would be responsible to get it to the next level. Is it how standardized are those action plans among the industry in general, whether they're between different agents, different real estate agents or different mortgage, how do you call them, mortgage advisors? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt's a great question. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMortgage loan officers. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, mortgage loan. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI would say there's a standard of sales methodology of you want seven touch points until I've gotten seven touch points and a meeting, blah. I don't consider this client a client or standards around following up at certain times to keep clients. But other than that, each realtor, each loan officer flies their own plane. They're associated with an agency, but it's up to them to keep track of these client touch points. However they build their system. For example, my cousin and her realtor friend Jess, they do a lot of gift baskets, they'll host events. They're very creative in how they give free value to their clients and how they appreciate their clients to get referrals. Not everyone's doing. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMy guess is that you exactly have described what is either realtors or lenders. I would call them mortgage agents because very often they're called this way in Poland. So I'm mixing up the next. So let's call them mortgage agents. Both of those groups, they probably think about these workflows, these action plans as their unique differentiation or advantage. This is kind of years of experience of how to service the client. There is some kind of a playbook that is a standard among the whole industry, but you probably know where I'm going with that. Whenever you think about implementing an automation, you may always trying to scope the work and think about it in this way. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThis is going to cost me x amount of hours of my effort and it's going to impact in this case probably one person or maybe a couple of people, because basically these agents doesn't want to share. They wouldn't be happy if you created automated their own know how and years of experience how to service the client and then go to all industry and just copy paste it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo let me share what I saw regarding that. I saw templates and follow up boss that seemed really good. That seemed very straightforward, very simple, and probably pretty effective without any personalization, any uniqueness of the know how, or this specific business is just changing the name of the prospect. And I was actually impressed at how straightforward, natural sounding these messages were. However, there's going to be more on top of that when it comes to tagging people and putting them in the right action plan. Those things that would be manual, especially for adding new contacts in from an event, something like that. That's something that is very time consuming. That's something that this person does not want to spend time on, doesn't want to have to spend time on. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd in terms of standardization of say, following up in the industry, I think that is replicatable enough that there would be no, hey, but you made this for me with my help, that the agent wouldn't be like, this belongs to me. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThere's no, okay, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOn top of the fact that what Devin really, I think a dream outcome for her is if we get a solid set up using follow up boss and whatever integrations you can use, what follow up boss allows you to do, like many CRMs is have multiple users. So a realtor that she's working with know, essentially sign into some of the same accounts and be able to view the client pipeline without having to ask Devin. So there's this sort of seamless integration where all of the people involved in getting a client through the entire home buying process, which is a lot, are able to have this centralized access. And I mean, we talked for almost 2 hours and she was spinning ideas and there's a lot of ways that we're going to take this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShe's excited about it and she's like, I haven't even touched on my actual work. This is all for client touch point and retention. This doesn't even touch the processes that happen once someone goes under contract. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nApproving a mortgage has many steps with many people. And there's two people involved in this from the second person that we met with was like, I'm getting all these dumb questions about things that should already be known by my team. So my team is asking me, hey, what's the fee on this? And it's stuff that she has either already told them or isn't a document that they just have to look into all those things that could be optimized and save everybody a lot of time and headaches we haven't even touched on. So that's what pegs is referring to now, the actual processes of lending a mortgage. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSounds great. Okay, well, thank you for this answer. Just a small note. We know each other a little bit, but you're going to probably, as we are going further, get to know me that bit more. So we just mentioned about my character and how I work. I don't want to be discouraged that I ask questions because I always at the beginning think about like where is something that we might maybe omitted or haven't noticed. So it's not the thing that I'm trying to find. I'm just trying to find weak spots. But this is to be just sure that there is nothing that we will just crush into it. Right. That's why I'm asking. But this sounds really great. My guess was why I was asking these questions. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo I was thinking in the sense of how to, whether it is or not, kind of a project that you work a lot, but it impacts only one person's workflow versus impacting 100 people or 500 people. So when you speak to small businesses, business owners and especially freelancers, individuals like these guys, like those agents, my guess is, or my worry is that I will only impact their own one person job. Right. One person workflow. That's why I was asking about the standardization, whether we are able to copy paste the solution and multiply the effect, multiply the value, because we eventually want to end money. So I'm trying to assess how big the value is. Of course, that's going to be a great way and great satisfaction to improve one person's workflow. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut let's say that how that person would be able to price that she might feel eventually that how much it's worth. That's going to be the question that we would need to start thinking very early in the process. That's why I'm asking whether we are able to sell it more. That's why we would be able to approach her and say, yeah, if we are able to sell it in the future to different people, we can develop for you for free because we're going to earn some work in the future in the process. These are my thoughts. That's the way I'm thinking. Okay. Just want to. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThis is everything we talked about. These are all her ideas. I just showed you two, which is this and this. And we still have all of this. We can talk about these later. It doesn't matter. But there's opportunity for several minor projects that have low effort, relatively low effort at medium impact, medium lifestyle impact. We showed up to the meeting yesterday and we started 45 minutes late because she forgot that she had a call at the time that were going to meet. It's lifestyle impact and her lifestyle is in great part entrenched in her job. So lifestyle impact is productivity at work impact. So at a medium impact, low effort, very replicatable for people that are going through the exact same pain points as she is. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. If she's open for reusing the templates to different realtors. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat'S what she wants. She wants the highest quality thing for her and for everybody around her that she works with. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, you mentioned about. Yeah, exactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt's a very symbiotic relationship that they have, which is not the whole real estate industry. If you talk to an individual agent and you ask them how do you feel about other real estate agents? My assumption is that the answer is not going to be very positive. However, she's in a situation where if she wins and the people around her wins, everybody wins. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMore. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nPerfect, though your concern, or your question rather is very suitable, which is how standardized is it? The action plans that we're implementing for her as a mortgage lender versus a real estate agent. And sure, 1 hour and a half consultations will still be needed to find the suitable things, the tweaks, everything but thesis that once it's built, once the next builds are that much faster, it, in this case I believe it applies. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, sounds great. I'm looking for a deck. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd if you help us create a deck for Wednesday that would be fucking awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, sure. At this moment I'm looking for kind of because you know that at the very beginning we worked with real estate agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOh, I forgot about that. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, it was very early in our collaboration with Votek head name or company or a brand, just let me find. Yeah, well can I show you something at this moment? Let me share the screen. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n1 second. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, you got it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBear with me. It's in polish and it's really old tech. Yeah. So what we have done with this first preclin, we also touched on their kind of a market position. This is the deck that I have created as a kind of a summary, our first discovery workshop and also kind of a process mapping workshop. So we've been also touching on their kind of strategy basically. And also we're trying to align their AI initiatives and automation initiatives to this positioning. So you won't understand a word, but I just wanted to say that after the couple of slides summing up the different initiatives, that's just similarly, as you have in your notion we have identified, this is the first initiative, the second initiative, the third, the fourth, 5th, 6th, 7th, all eight, blah, blah, doesn't matter. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWe started to put those initiatives on the kind of four field axis when you compare ROI. So return on investment with kind of a speed to get the first results, time. So the horizontal line reflects the time and effort that is necessary to get the first result. And the vertical one is ROI. So we asked the guy, after getting, having those workshops finished and ideating on all those possible places that we can implement some automation, we asked the guy to score them the initiatives. Like we picked the first nine because we wanted to work in phases. We said that let's not discuss about 90 of them, let's focus on the first nine. That seems the best for the beginning and let's score them. Like the higher the scoring, the better ROI. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd oh, that's not the deck because I also had the one that had scoring and not the scoring, but the results. But you can just imagine that we had this map that showed us, or maybe let me show it on this one because I also showing kind of how we work with these things. So we very often work on processes. That's our kind of backbone of how we analyze the workflows and where we identify those opportunities to implement an automation. And when we identify the automation, we score it. As you can see here, very often it's quite good because of course the best position is to be high on ROI and fast to measure impact. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut quite often it's also wise to look for those quick wins that maybe they might have lower ROI, but are quite easy to implement, to have, for example, organizational buy in or stuff like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is kind of. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut of course, usually the better ROI has those bigger initiatives and we try to put all those initiatives on this prioritization map. Also, we look like it's my thing because I love those strategic aspects. We also looking at the positioning of the company, whether they are kind of. For example, this is one of the frameworks that we can use. Whether you work or want to be a company that works in a kind of operational excellence or you are wanting to focus more on customer intimacy. So being very close to your client, this is typically the type of operation how real estate agents work because this is all about relations. So the operational model in this strategy is a little bit different than, for example, when you focus on product leadership or trying to be cost effective. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nJust wanted to mention that this looks like a little bit like you are in this stage when you ideate all those solutions or maybe possible automation ideas. And I would suggest or recommend to you maybe to think about. Then let's move to the prioritization and roadmapping, what to go first with, where you already decided on a couple of those things. But you might think about whenever there's going to be a client that's going to be commercial, that there's going to be a money put on, that you might want to try to assess what's going to be the cost, what's going to be the time and what's going to be the value that is going to be brought by the solution and try to assess how much money they, for example, going to end on save. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo the two that I showed you are definitely the low hanging fruits, and that was off of her comments, but our intuition, I really like that we actually get to meet and explore this further with you today because you're bringing this more structured lens, right, where we can develop and then decide and have just clear justification for those decisions. And also on Wednesday, when we talk to the client and her team and her core team, which is four people, I believe we can show them. This is where we've mapped things in terms maybe of effort, and there could be a space where we say, what would be the ROI for you? Or we could estimate Roi based on the conversation we had yesterday. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nGreat. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBecause she did make some of them very clear, like, oh, this would be a huge help right now. And when she goes a huge help, it's like, oh, okay, high Roi. So there were some that were very easy to identify as high roi opportunities. The two that I selected were the low effort opportunities that also will have, say, medium impact. But let's actually look at it in the map. What deck could you maybe send us? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOf course. Yeah. I'm happy whenever there's going to be, you see any value and exactly that why I'm showing, because I'm showing because I think that might be useful for you. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, for sure. We do need to simplify a lot. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWhat the dev will look like. We're talking maybe four or five slides plus one or two of who we are at the beginning. Pictures of the team and stuff. Kind of set up the authoritative position and then four or five, something simple. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut that we do show. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHey, these were the ideas that were discussed, where they fit in the ROI. What else comes up, what else needs to be put on this table? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, that's actually a great point or great occasion to get back to the nose rentals deck that I have got it to like 50% and because the guy wasn't ready for. But this is actually a good occasion to get back to him and say, hey, hello, how are you now? Because he told me that he is in a high season in the sense that he was so busy that I think that he dropped the kind of a program that we had been or met in because I haven't seen him on any of the work. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, the mini Mba? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I guess he was in the mini mba. I think so, yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd I have finished the program and I have never seen him again. So he's probably really busy. But that's going to be. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe busy season is ending now. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOh, great. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's already March. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat's a great. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. But probably I will drop canva because I have created one deck for syllabus some time ago, but I picked, as you are a subscriber, you can pick those kind of a premiere layouts that you have the designs already made for you. And the one that we started to work in is the one that you have all the elements you need to create them by yourself. So you have to basically draw from the blank page almost. So I started to draw a lot, but it was so time consuming that they go to the 50% and then move to another thing. Sorry, guys, but that's going to be actually a great. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWell, I'm sure if you, Powell and you, Paige, get together on canva, you'll be able to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFigure out how to. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nMake it fast, beautiful and effective together. Because I know both of you have. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSome experience on canva. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI know Paige has quite a bit. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOf experience on canva. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nRelatively. In that case, if you want to drop your subscription, go ahead. We've been thinking about buying a subscription for faster eyes and it's probably a good time to do. Right, Paige? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight now, I've just been using the subscription we have to my other company and it'd be nice to have a space for our stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBe great. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLet me think about it. Actually, canva is not the most expensive. You know what's actually pretty expensive? I was thinking about purchasing LinkedIn Navigator, but it's not only LinkedIn Navigator, safe navigator. Sorry. But also you need to buy, purchase those data enrichment tools. It costs like â‚¬150. So we have a month. So we have actually using the data from our. We have this kind of a zack of ours that is really busy. There is an option on the table that he might maybe get to know you guys, but he got just recently from his own emailing called mailing campaign. He got so many inquiries, so many clients that he is not able to help us now. Lagging a little bit. He got so many clients, so he's really busy now. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut we are using a little bit of his databases and access, say that at some time, LinkedIn Navigator plus some kind of data enrichment, because when you get to the LinkedIn service navigator, you can pull downloads or databases, some contacts, but they don't have all the data. There are some extra services that enrich this data with emails, phones and anything that the user haven't shared. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHow does it work? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI see. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBut he's paying a lot of money and he has some kind of. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWell, I can ask him for accommodations if he would be interested. Also, I know that Nan has hacked LinkedIn some time ago and shared some kind of huge database. I haven't looked into that yet. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWhat, you mean the 700 million contacts that I have in my computer right now? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIs it usable? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHave you looked at that? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt is time consuming to sift through, understand, and even try to open the files because they're so big that your computer just won't open them. But I'm a data scientist, so this. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIs literally. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt'S just not been enough time that I can actually create a map. But I do have a plan for drawing it out. And yes, the answer is yes. And we also have about 900,000 contacts for real estate in those lists. Out of which to be, if I were to estimate, probably 200, 300,000 are valid. Like valid emails. 200,000 is great. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. Let's say that we have 1% conversion. So that's 0.1% conversion. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt's more than we can handle. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt's more than we can handle. That's enough for a year of development. Exactly, yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo the massive outreach system, the personalized massive outreach system, partly scrapes a LinkedIn. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nPage. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTo get sort of relevant data. We might look into doing Instagram, too. We can look into that, but scrapes the LinkedIn data, including recent posts, and find hooks, find relevant things to start the email with, and we transition into value offer. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSounds great. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI'm excited to show you that system. And there's going to be quite a bit of human review as we fine tune it. So us doing like a workshop one day where we say, hey, these are the icebreakers that it came up with. What is good about them, what is bad about them? And fine tuning each part of the process. And a B test, which we get to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe get to a B test when. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWe have that many contacts. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I'd love to say it. That sounds really good in terms of this 700 million database thing. Have you been trying maybe putting uploading that because you have Microsoft account and some gold in this, my Microsoft account from this program that I. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-01 Paige, Bartek, Pawel - Plans and Updates for Real Estatecleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nWe've got you mentioned membership agreements with the LLC. We talked about the competency matrix contracts.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe made it to Australia.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh, yeah. I fly in about six.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo you're going to Thailand. Is that what heard?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI realized today I'm running these virtual programs twice a year, working with this group we've been working with since 2019, and I realized that the time I have to do one on Saturday at 05:00 a.m. Because of the time difference. And then when we're in Bali, it'll be at 01:00 a.m.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nEventbrite is being a little annoying and not letting me log in, so I think I'll just figure this later. Okay. Let's see. So things to talk about. Low hanging fruits for real estate automations. So, competency matrix. Did you get a chance to pull up the work that Powell did? Let's take a look at it now.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDo you have it? Okay, I can share if you don't.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's a few messages up in the develop advocates chat.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGo up to skills inventory. These are the skills that we need to make sure they make sense and they're skills we want to evaluate people on. A lot are dev related, but not all. And then if you go one tab over, there's a proficiency level tab, which he hasn't fleshed out, but we need to establish what that is like. How are we kind of rating people's skills?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. So what we would need to do is look at these thousand dev skills and address each skill gap.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAs far as proficiency levels, I'm thinking about the one that we use for facilitation, alejo, the awareness, implementation, embody, and mastery.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe might change the word embodying.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFluidity maybe, or naturally.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnyway, what I did want to check is if it fills out here. So this is number one. Our job would first be going through these and filling it out ourselves and then start deleting things that we won't need because C sharp will never use. So bubble, I'm aware, exists. Never used it. We will come back to this.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI downloaded the airtable app on my phone, so I think I could just do that.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAs you all go through it, and I'll go through it too. A lot of the ones that are dev related, I'm going to be either awareness or zero. You can leave notes on any ones that you're like, we're never going to use this. We should just take this out of here. Or if there's something missing, we can add it.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDon't we need at a fifth skill level, which is before awareness, because some of them we're just not going to be aware of.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, we can.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo in that case, we'll probably not fill out the column or just wouldn't.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, he really stepped up and on his advocate duties.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, in handy. Let's have a review, cleanup session and launch it. Yay. Okay, wonderful. The important topics that all of us and Bartek explicitly want to know about, which is the real estate project and what does that look like, the things that we agreed to and when will the money come?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, we could. I mean, if we go back to our Figma and look at kind of a project distribution, we could start laying out what that looks like.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDo you want to share screen and show me what you mean?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWill you pull up? Do you have the Figma up? I can pull it up.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDo you remember how there was like project leadership team and then we need to set that up. Who's on that team and then seeing what else.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, will you make me co host?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou can share screen.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight here. And then.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIf you go to the left, zoom out a bit. Useful archive. Wait, I'm in a different.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm looking for. Yep, I see you, Henry. Ok, right here.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo when marketing efforts bring in a lead. When someone else brings in the lead, that's what we'll be looking at.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. So the last update was profit, lead fee goes in cost. So regardless of who brought it and regardless of how much it is, we make it part of the cost.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMake a new one. I remember having that conversation.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCopy and pasted from the other side, right?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Well, we can still look at the other one.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWith this project. But I don't mean like completely new town. Just draw it out differently.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think I liked this. Well, this gives a bit of a breakdown of what is project leadership, right?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, I'm waiting on my.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. Oh, isn't it that one? Yeah, it's that one. Profit sharing. There we go. So in the bottom one.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis looks the same.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat looks the exact same. So if you zoom in, I wasn't going to create, like, a new schema. So the hive brings lead, 30% cost ten to 20%. Yes. There you go. So that is the new change.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMess with the lead feed sales and marketing now. Or are we making a distinction because honestly, right now we don't have any marketing efforts really happening.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I think we maybe put that money towards just a bank for marketing.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo outreach is all about getting the sale. It's not unreasonable that if outreach doesn't make the sale and they don't get the money unless they're involved in a different part.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI agree with Henry. Given the current state of marketing, I'd be okay putting that 15% towards ad campaign budget.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo what is our marketing effort right now?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's just the videos I've put out so far.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, you put it out. It's like a YouTube channel.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think so.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPost it on our Instagram and our.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is a scenario, say we set it up now without the marketing, but then we have them on retainer and then suddenly we do start doing more marketing efforts. How do we go about that?Speaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHow do we go about dividing the retainer? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, because do we have a different template for the retainer and different template for the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI see what you. Fantastic question. The retainer has been established that is purely of the people that work for it. Meaning a dev is assigned to a project in the medium long term and they receive 100% minus costs of the retainer. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo here's one thought, and I agree with that. And then the scenario is as we get this project going, we have more video content and sort of demo product proof that marketing would then be working on. That would then come out of another. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMarketing fund that would lead to a new sale. So ideally that content from a testimonial is marketing that boosts the next sale. So marketing gets paid. The other thing is the retainer is not only for devs as we realize companies need help with marketing. So a lot of help with marketing. So there's going to be marketing. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnother one could be. Oh, they also want marketing done. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nExactly. Okay. In this case, this one is going to be both. It's going to be marketing and dev. Yeah, of course. Just to note, it is very much still initiative based. So if I'm learning the follow up API, I'm creating a GBT with all the knowledge base. I'm recording how I'm making it, all that stuff. That initiative is essentially what gets you paid nowadays, especially with simple projects. Especially with projects that are, oh, Avi is the only person that has the skills in order to complete this is more, we're on more on the basic side. So it's very much initiative based. Go learn it. Go do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBefore. Be helpful to you also to get a sense of what the cost and what we're looking at for this project is the operation shared members of operations. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPart of the conversation that we need to have within advocates is who's still an advocate, right. There's two that were cleaned from the group because we have to start making decisions. Lecton Pavan. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think about JK, who up until probably a month ago ish has been around, but he's been focused on his own stuff. Haven't really heard from him for a month, hasn't been joining calls or communicating, which is fine. But then the question would be like, who would we include in this operations? And then it goes back to the question we've circled through a few times that does go, I think, align with the competency matrix and the membership agreements of what is an active member and what would you need to do perhaps on a monthly basis to get looped into the operations hub or the marketing hub as a person? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I think, yeah, I see what you mean. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOr is it people in op that are showing up. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAlso? I feel like there's not much set for operations and this template is set for growth. So when we do grow, we are. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nVery much, we need to do a pitch deck in 24 hours, dude. The next 24 hours we need Powell to step up and edit his pitch deck that he had done. And that's like heavy load. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI can also help with that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI have the template also in the background. Of course, there's always stuff going on. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCould you send it over whenever it's done as well? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, yeah. Ideally we kind of work on it together and you also get a feel for real estate in general. Okay. So yes. For some numbers, let's look at it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDo you want to share your screen, Alijo, since you're doing the thing? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSure. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet me share this real quick because it's. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGuys, I probably got like an hour at most and then I probably should stop. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, I think I need to focus on the dev thing so we can look at some stuff at the dev meeting. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat were working on together. This kind of gives us a template that we can use as we map out the project. And it definitely needs a lot of work, but we have a base with a little bit of branding and I've got to undouble brand it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLove that. There was two decks that Powell shared last time, one for real estate and one for general pitch, or rather in depth AI audit. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, yeah, we'll have to ask him for that shared with us. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCould you check your email? Sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHave you checked the AA resources for the pitch decks? Because I think they might have some, especially regarding retainer and stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's a good idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBetter retainer sort of thing. Set up template. That explain what I did. The fastest way to find it is probably dropping a message in the channels and just saying. Then Keith will probably just point you in the right direction. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. We've got to get our own canva. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, we do. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI don't mind canva. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHere we go. I think this is what we're talking about. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat are you on about? The pitch deck I gave you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou gave me? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. The one that I did with. Why have I forgot his name? Oh, my God. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFour. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI want to say Eric. It's not Eric. I know his name's not the one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHe's finished. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPitch decker for principal Skinner. Oh, she was talking about selling in. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, they're selling. They're going to make a stupid amount of money. This is so ridiculous. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSelling metal pins. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThey're Disney pins. That. People are fanatics. Thousands of them. The things and how to tell whether they're real or fake or whatever. But yeah, they're going to start selling a bunch of them. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAre you on about the one I did with Edward for the retail? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I think it's that one. I kept thinking about Edward. It's like, what am I thinking about? Edward? Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet me share this with you guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMy thing about Edward. Search four. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThere wasn't a set price in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut it's going to be 500. Yeah. Which is going to be things like use Opus Pro to edit these videos. Teach Sandra, the marketing person for this team, how to use Opus pro. That's part of what the retainer pays for, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHey, edit this. Add one action plan. We're not going to charge extra for one more action plan. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, but. Well, the first one or two automations will be free, which are relatively simple. And then some of the other ones will continue to build on. There's a lot of potential for growth. I think a few of them will be connecting action plans in follow up box to Trinder, another company that does to people. Devin will send out anyone who is tagged as a realtor in her CRM. Every quarter there's a trigger. Oh, it's the end of quarter. Now, I'm going to send all of my realtor information to this company and they're going to send out this gift basket to all the realtors. There are parts of the action plans for clients when they reach settlement day. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI don't know exactly what she does, but trigger to this other company to send them, I don't know, a bottle of champagne and a note saying, congratulations. That kind of thing. They do a lot of that sort of gifting and thank you touch points for referrals and whatnot. And it takes a lot of time. And she's like, I don't want to have touch this because I need to be talking to realtors and I need to be talking to people who want to buy homes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. This one's set up in milestones, so project overview and then you've got your milestone. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd that makes sense. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's something that will change. Okay, looking at this pitch deck real quick. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSlide nine is the best one with the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, sure. Nothing much to share, but this is the pitch. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, this one. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThere you go. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo you want Powell to remake this? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDoes Powell have another pitch deck that he's remaking for this project? Yeah. Okay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, way better design, way easier to follow, I think. Less words, keep it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPurposes. We could take kind of merge this one with the template that I have from Pavel. I have a couple of those templates. Put our language in it and we're good to go. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I think this one's very, I don't know, it looks pretty shit. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I don't like it. Hey, who are all these people? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI know, that's what I was thinking. I think maybe I shared the link. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, there's definitely two people who are not us right now in this deck. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhich might be Edward looking at it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd now. Okay, let's get moving. So we have enough time. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'll pull the back up the figma because I think we should look at the numbers. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI guess we don't know the fixed cost for third solution yet, do we? Or do we have a ballpark figure? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, the max is $200 a month. The minimum is going to be like probably $50 a month. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAre we retainer for the. Are we not doing an upfront fee for the development of just an automation? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, these first two are going to be free. Let's go back. Let's go back. You asked about numbers. Let's look at numbers. I'm going to share screen love. Stop sharing. Yeah, this is the project essentially this automation. Get a text message, create a task and follow a boss and create an appointment on the calendar. That's going to be the first one. It's going to be the free one. And then action plans, which is a hub of all clients. Different clients have different tags and different tags have different action plans. Different sets of tasks. Different sets of tasks, period. Those two we're going to implement for free. Those are the two that feel most needed. Highest necessity, highest ROI to effort ratio. We want to do these programmatically, automatically. So obviously there's API that gets involved, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd for purposes of the next time we sell this, we should like, let's put a value on what we would charge someone that we're not going to do these for free. We're doing these for free. Great idea for referrals. And my cousin essentially told me whatever you all do for me is just going to be copy paste for my mom, implement the same thing. And she's got a lot of people who need this. So let's figure out what we would charge someone. We're not doing the free for the free. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, that's a good idea. Go for the auto scheduler. We're talking about being able to, obviously ignoring cost. The integration is a bit of prompt engineering for all the side cases, special cases of how a person might write an appointment, they might say the place in one message and then the time in the next message. Or maybe it's a back and forth reply, deciding which place. So that'll take some testing. Testing means developer hours. And essentially what I said to her, what I said to Devin, which is pretty well correlated to reality, is like, we'll charge you for developer hours for how much our devs put into it, obviously, plus a markup. So we have to figure out essentially how many hours and how much we actually want to charge. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRate is, I guess because I have no idea what my rate. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think it's $100 an hour. I think all of our rates are $100 an hour. And then the cool thing about how we set up our. So let's start there, then start with the main question, how we set up this profit sharing. The cool thing about it is that, no, this got not well pasted anyway. The cool thing about that is that development is going to get paid by the type of work that they do. So if they're heavily involved or a minor contributor. So those hours at the end of the day get paid what fasterized charges gets distributed to developers based on their involvement in the project, meaning that at the end of the day, some hours, say, for senior engineers, are going to be paid more than for junior engineers that can only have so much involvement in complex projects. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is a simple project. So at a baseline of $100 an hour per project per developer, let's write it down here. $100 an hour per developer. Okay. Great rates it might take. It's already been kind of 1 hour. We're talking. Read the text messages. We have to find the right services we have. And, and it might just be Tulio's API. Honestly. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nTwilio can just be a lot of nitpicking. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIn what way? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI've always had problems with Twilio. That's why I went with go high level, because so much easier. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. In that case, that is the service that does it for you. And it's $150 a month. So that's the thing to keep in mind. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo the one that does it for me is LC lead connector, but all it does is provide the phone number. So the problem with Twilio was getting the phone number off Twilio. It wasn't the APIs that was trying out, if that makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGetting the phone number off of Twilio, what do you. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLike? You know how you can go get business numbers? Getting a business number off Twilio and then setting it upright for use in Europe, you had to go send off loads of documents and then it had be in Europe. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTwilio is not the way to go, that's for sure. I got validation of that. And now a second validation from what you're saying. Fortunately, this is us, and this person has their own phone number, and we should use her own phone number because it's not like we're going to be spamming messages everywhere. It's going to be every once in a while there's a message that will need to be replied to automatically, like a confirmation of an appointment. And honestly, even at first, probably even shouldn't do automatic, but would you not rather automatic meaning instead of Devin texting, the message gets sent and Devin never. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think the prompt would need to include like someone sends the task and the task is confirmed by Devin's phone number and then it generates the event. And I know I might be talking V two and I might be getting ahead of myself, but I'm thinking about being a user and having this, which I would love to have. It would be, I think, a huge help if somehow, okay, someone sends a message. Are we good for our meeting tomorrow at 03:00 p.m.. Yes. Confirmed. It makes the event in Google Calendar and there's some sort of notification that goes to Devin that confirms that the event was created in Google Calendar. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that she doesn't have to go back into Google Calendar and make sure that it's there. And then if she doesn't get the confirmation, she knows that there's something wrong and she can contact us. But it's that validation. And in a perfect world, I just imagine the sounds and the visuals. When you click on Duolingo and you complete something and it's like done, you get that sort of psychological dopamine rush. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWith some systems I've dealt with. So with go high level, when you want to set up a notification, there's a few ways you can do it. You can do an SMS directly to their phone or they actually have a lead connector app which is like a go high level mobile phone app which is like how they check their casually on their phone or their stats and then they get a notification on that app. So I'd be curious, does follow up have a mobile app and if so, we can probably API notifications to the follow up app, which would also be less costly than sending. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOut follow up boss. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGoogling it right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. It might be a white label app. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou need a paid follow up boss subscription to use the mobile app. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhich I'm sure she does. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo we can probably send notifications to that app if not. And what I do is maybe because there'll be loads of notifications we can send in and we don't want to bombard her phone with move stages in pipeline. We only want to deal with made, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we don't know that for sure yet. She might want bombing of like this got confirmed. This moved here, this moved here, this confirmed. We don't know for sure that she does or doesn't want that. User experience. That's what we're talking about on Tuesday. User experience too. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBeautiful new lead notification. Know exactly who's calling you. Easy call and textual leads through the app. Yeah. So I think the app is a bit. If we automate the app then she doesn't have to combine her own imessages with her leads, right? She can, but it won't look the same. But for her leads it will look like they're just messaging on imessage but she's actually doing it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo when you say automate the app, does that require a different automation setup or. I'm wondering if the automation. Yeah, I guess it would be. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think it's just more of a focus of looking at the APIs on follow up boss and looking at how we that. Because I also know setting up the SMS stuff could be like an extra two steps for no reason. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. I've been trying to minimize. I did find an integration that makes us not even have to connect Google Calendar, like not have to call it manually to create the event from follow up boss. The Google Calendar event can be created. So that's one less step that we have to do. Connect. And let's see if this sounds like. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt could just be customizing their follow up bus account with an automation mind on it. So can you get us access to their follow up boss account with just a fast rise team user? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, definitely. And now I have all of the documentation, the 200 pages of follow up boss documentation, API documentation ready. They're here so we can make a chicket. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, you're only sharing one screen by the way. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, we're not following which I don't know if this automation. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, now you're in that one or this URL of the API documentation, it just like scraped anyway. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo if we description just throw it into chat GPT, that's a lot of our work done. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh yeah, it's a lot of work done. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd part of the prompting because when you go back to this version, Alejo, this is actually not the first version that we're starting with because I guess we could. Right now my cousin is using follow up boss personally. It's not connected to her work email. She's working on getting that approved by the company. So it's text message to Google Calendar and it's a text message that's either about an appointment or a meeting or a text message that includes a task that eventually, or maybe even sooner than eventually, we connect with follow up boss because there's tasks that she goes in there and she has her daily tasks that she does. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou know what would also be probably very useful is follow up boss. I'm assuming they have really good customer service. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nProbably do. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd if it's high level we could sit in a call with one of the team from follow up Boss for free. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm actually going to look such a good idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm wondering if her data guy is from follow up Boss. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIntegrate directly with follow up Boss. Interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI don't even have make.com listed there, but it does work with make. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, you just need the API part as opposed to the integration. Appointments? Appointments. What I know is that if I go to inbox, there is this like text test text. It's an example inbout reply to me and then I can connect this service which is $150 a month and it would probably take care of most of this is great. This works. This is great for. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, Alejo, try download the mobile app and log in. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm downloading it now. Tasks me how tasks work. You guys can hear the sound. You'll hear the sound enough. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI can't hear that. The sound of no, we can't hear. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt between tasks that are due today, tasks that have gone past their due date without being complete. Action task. You prioritize your day and focus on what matters until you're ready to take action. Tasks assigned to you will be visible both on the task page and on the individual contacts profile. You can toggle your view between tasks that are due today, tasks that have gone past their due date without being complete, and any tasks upcoming in the future. You can click the lead's name to easily jump to their profile and take action if need be. Or check the box on the left to mark the task as completed. You can also use the filters at the top right to change which tasks you're viewing. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFor example, if you have a lot of tasks but only limited time, you can use filters to narrow down the list to only view your call tasks for the day. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. Okay, so ideally we're creating tasks. Well, no, we're definitely creating tasks programmatically. And now I have my Google calendar connected. So if I create a task on here, let's try it. If I create a task on here, new task, say overdue. I want to. No, I want to add a task. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think you have to go change tasks up at the top bar where it says you're on the p. Yeah, that probably works. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI came up with a name for testing environment for our code team. Fast test. Yeah. From me. Date is tomorrow at, say, 01:00 p.m. Set a reminder. Oh, this is what she wanted too, that reminder. Okay, great day before. What time is it in the US right now? In Kevin, check my multiple 05:00 p.m. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's 09:30 a.m.. There. But what time is it for them? I think it's 04:00 p.m. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo 930 or four. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAre you asking what time it is now? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\n04:00 p.m.. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. So the call tomorrow is at 01:30 a.m. Our time. Yeah, 01:00 a.m. Our time. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe call tomorrow should be our 08:00. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nA.M.. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, go ahead. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDo a notification both ways, so remind them as well. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's what I'm trying to test. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe will be meeting with her our time at 08:00 a.m. On Wednesday the 6th, which is her 04:00 p.m. On Tuesday the fifth. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIs a task the best way to set a call, or is it that meant to be in events and tasks are like prepare for the call. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhere do you see events? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI don't know. I just know in go high level because my brain goes to the reminder for the task is only reminding you to do the task, not all participants of the task, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, correct. It would be for her. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm pretty sure you can assign somebody else, too. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOnly employees. So I don't know. Is there like a nava way to set an event different to a task? It's just my question. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI don't think so. I think tasks is everything here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, yeah, you have the task and then you have the calendar, which I think are two different things. And she wants to use her Google calendar because I think she has her. I don't think she's using the follow up boss calendar to manage her life. She wants all of her work tasks in her Google calendar. She also wants all of the lists of tasks, which are the things to do in her high level task list, but also as events on her Google calendar. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat we could do then is if the calendar. We don't even need the Google API. You just need to set up two way sync with the calendars so that when she. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's the thing. It's already set up. Okay. So check it out. The event is here. It's created in my Google calendar at 1131 40, my time, and I should now be getting a notification on. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCan you do me follow up? Can you set up an event in your Google calendar and see if it transfers back to boss? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYep. Yep. All these events are from my Google calendar. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd if you go up to the task on the top bar, just to the left of the calendar, view up all the way up. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGray person. What? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGray the task. So this, I think, is where she puts her actual right. And that came through so fast. Test one came through. So it would list the task here in follow up boss, and then it would also go to Google Calendar. I just wanted to see that because sometimes what's in her Google calendar will be an actual meeting, not necessarily a to do item. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's what I'm thinking. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. But then also it's kind of how we use our Google calendars. We put our to do things that we're going to do for the day in our calendar. And I've seen your Google calendar, Henry. I know you do the same thing. That also includes meetings. So it's like everything that you have to do today, whether it's a meeting or a task, is in the Google calendar, which it looks like that went to both places. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. I'm really interested to see how hers is set up and if her calendar events are set up in tasks or just in calendar, if that makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I think she has calendar. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo for example, say you need to book a call with someone and say you and me and we discuss, we're making a call and I'm the real estate person. Do I log into here and go to tasks and create a task for the call or do I just go onto my Google calendar, create the call? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause if I just, I'm pretty sure isn't going to follow up boss to write who is she meeting with and when. I'm pretty sure she would just write that in her Google calendar. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBecause then it doesn't get set as the task, if that makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCorrect. It wouldn't get set as task but the objective would be fulfilled, which is that it shows up in her Google calendar. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd that's a good question for her because I see some value in it being in both places. But go ahead. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nShe wouldn't get the reminder. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShe can get a remembrance through calendar. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, true. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Which is probably better. So I'm trying to log into the mobile app and then we can proceed to the next topic. Okay, I'm logging in. Yep. Okay. Anyway, so we have the dev meeting in 1 hour and this I would like to bring kind of worked on turn on notifications, open settings. Okay. Email and text messages show up here. If I want to send a text to somebody. Well my number would be recorded in there so we could try that and I can see this test. I don't see the reminder, but that's fine because it does show up in my Google calendar. Okay. So yeah, the answer is yes, it works. Always texting. I send all text via follow up boss. Always text in app. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I would just need to change my phone number to my actual one and that would be that. Okay. What questions do we have? Lovely. So a text out of that. I'll get around to it. We talked about, you had a question? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo, I was just saying let's go to the next topic. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, cool. We'll get around to these details for now. This looks good. Next topic. Well, I guess topic you asked about profit sharing. Retainers. Retainers, they divided by the people who are assigned, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. But you've also got to cover the operating costs. So for example the Opus pro cost per month that's going to be in the retainer. And then you've got the two people, the one person probably just for Opus pro who's doing that. And then you've also got the other general updates to the automations. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Example, $500 a month retainer, $100 cost per month to one engineer, one marketer. So dollars -100 equals 400, go to 202 hundred marketer. Okay, well, does that help clear it up or does it complicate it? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI close it up, it's just. I know, just thinking it won't always be divided evenly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI guess the work will not always be divided evenly. No. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCan you. Sorry if I missed it. The $200 for the marketer, that's for Opus Pro. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIf you're doing marketing services for them. So say if the retainer. Okay, I see marketing services and I want the engineer like the project to be up to date and stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, so we are paying marketing out of retainer. I thought that were not. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, let's start from the top. So we charge something for a project, a certain amount gets charged up front. That amount gets divided like this. That's one way that we earn income. Way number two, that we earn income. Retainers. Retainers. However much we charge, we reduce the cost, we subtract the cost and then we divide that amount between the members assigned. An example is that if we charge 500 a month retainer and our cost is 100 a month and we have one engineer and one marketer, that means that it's $500 for the retainer -100 divided by two. So $400 divided by two. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe math I get. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think the difference is for this, we're paying them out of retainer for marketing, because they're doing marketing not for fast rise, but as a service for someone else, rather than 10% normally, or 15%. That would be, I see, marketing for us. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, so this would be specific to this project for the retainer. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, just an example. And we have also talked about this being the retainer for this project. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, that's clear to me. I just got confused because when we talked about retainers earlier, we talked about 100% of retainers going to Dev and that the marketers would get paid out of the other revenue share model, which doesn't pertain to the retainer. So theoretically we'd have some kind of project set up or installation cost or fee which would follow the revenue share model. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWell, I think it makes sense if you're thinking it depends on what they request as a service. So for example, if they're my Facebook ads every month, you don't want to just charge a one time fee for that. You would want the marketer on retainer for the hours they're putting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYep. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIn this case because some of the services require marketing, which might know training. And maybe it's a per month sort of assessment on what the needs are for the project. I'm imagining maybe one month, it's a 50 split. But then maybe once their marketing team is set up, then really it's only the development that's doing the. I don't know. Anyway, so for this project, because we're offering marketing services, a part of the solution, that is why the marketer is looped into this revenue. Okay, thank you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, cool. So what we had left is figuring out how many developer hours takes, which we don't really need to guess right now. We can just figure it out once it's developed. Right. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think one of the things is setting up project leadership and operations. Who's in that before the check comes in and then we suddenly decide who's getting the money. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, well, the check is not going to come in for a little bit, but yes, of course. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nQuestion. I know we are doing this. We're just talking about retainer for this project. So do we then not have funds that go back into the business? Are we accounting for that? Or is that included in the $100 cost? Or is that cost specifically the cost of the API integrations? Whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe're using monthly costs of this project. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut it wouldn't go into. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRetainer. So from my understanding of the project, it's not just a retainer, it's that, for example, the third automation we set up would be, let's say it's 1000 pounds. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGot it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd then we're also charging the retainer for maintaining that first project. And say they want marketing because a marketing. Oh, I need marketing help. It's just a service we can probably provide. And we're just into the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for helping me. I have jet lag, 02:00 a.m.. Brain. That makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, awesome. So what exactly does this look like and who's in what? Yes, moving on. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAvi is most likely somewhere in here. Engineers? No, in technical lead. Bartech has talked a lot about test driven development, but right now this is very fuzzy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. We're also talking per project. So this would be split up. It wouldn't be for the whole time we're working with this client. You've got to think that. So it would be. Okay. We're going to charge an upfront cost for the third automation. What's the project leadership team for that automation? Because that's how we're splitting that money. For example, there might be some projects where we don't need Avi, and Avi just doesn't have the time for it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThus, like now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, thus he's not on the project leadership team, but for the same client data for maybe a 7th automation, where it's a lot bigger or something. We bring him in on the project leadership, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. That's why I'm having, in part, why I'm having a conversation with him to see like, hey, where do you stand with us meeting, say, three times a week and talking, like, purely technical stuff? Because as our last conversation, it sounded like couple times a week would be feasible as long as we kind of aligned with his schedule. So all possible stuff. But we do need a highly technical, highly experienced person, and the only person we have with those requirements right now is Abby. Highly rigorous is something that we need because pasting things together is great for prototypes, but we're going to need some more rigorousness rigor. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI mean, Alejo, you could be the technical lead as well, by the way. Easily. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI could see how you'd think that it is. Technical lead does not align with the depth that I can get to. Let me give you an example. I'll throw an example out there. AI dialers. AI dialers are great, but they have an issue, which is latency. And if it came to, hey, how do we solve the latency issue with our calls? Because it makes it sound very much less human when they take a couple of seconds to answer whatever, continue the conversation, I would have no fucking clue where to start. A technical lead would at the very least know where to start, what questions to ask, and be able to wrap their head around latency, what the issues might be regarding it. That's not where I shine. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I am doing everything I can to not be technical lead on purpose, and if it came to it, I know I would do a good job. I know I would do a decent job at technical lead, especially for these sort of low sophistication projects. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLejo, do we remember what was the third automation project that we had kind of lined up for? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt wouldn't be for this client. It would be for about half of her referrals, which is leads in a spreadsheet. Get migrated to follow up boss. That's the third one. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet's just build out the template for that. So leads in a spreadsheet to follow up boss. That's one project. So that's one where you could easily be the technical lead, for example. And then I think project leadership is less of the, my main focus was towards operations and the guys because I also feel like us three are doing a lot of the operations just by having this call alone. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, absolutely. And that is at the end of the day, what counts. And let's figure out how you can make that explicit. That's requirement, like showing up and the flexibility around showing up because pulling out a pitch deck in three, four days to means showing up even if Paul is not in this meeting right now. So we have to figure out. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nKind of, I don't think Josiah would need to be here for this call exactly, but for example, creating a pitch deck and being there to speak to the client and maybe like an hour call before, just explain that. What would we think about that sort of input, of just. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, so we met up with Powell on Friday. We talked for like a couple hours and we gave him the whole lowdown on the project. And then during the call he pulled out, oh, hey, I also have these two decks. We could modify them and they would be more than appropriate for our call. So again, flexibility, that counts. It feels like when it counts, we can depend on them, at least on Powell. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWell, yeah. The way we set it up anyway was whoever brings in the lead is the project lead. So that's you two guides, and then you basically have the freedom to choose who you want on the project and who you want. I mean, I guess operations. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI hear what you're saying you want this year. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut not in the whole project actually. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight? Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat might help us is, and I'm trying to pull up this pitch deck right now to just start mapping this out. Because if we can get a high level view of the phases of this project, then we can start to get a sense of the level of expertise that we're going to need. Are we going to need super deep development on taking a picture of new leads and putting them into follow up, boss? Probably not. Probably something that between the two of you on this call could happen. And then we look at phase four, who are we going to need? What kind of automation are we talking about? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, is there anything else left to cover? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nToo many things, but we took a bunch of time on this and it's fine. So we'll have to kick it for next time. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat are the things? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's on the discord competency matrix contract for real estate project we haven't touched on contract. We haven't touched on membership agreement with the LLC. So the official agreement that everybody officially signs low hanging fruits for real estate, preparing a virtual event for fasterize so we're launching content on video leading up to a virtual event ops and advocates requirements. And then new members vote, which is Zach. The vote for him to become a member is due. And then Hooby and Leo is in one month. Leo is a friend of mine in sales. So those are all the topics we touched on, which is fine because we have to go deeper. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAlso, one question I've got, which I know is you know how the companies in both of your name, right, officially, when would I get my name on there as a founder? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, let me add to the list then do research on the right country to open up a multinational, multi founder LLC or corp. And that's what we have to do research on until we know that we can't. Really. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'm fine to just leave that in the backlog for ages, just until we sort of get flowing. But could it not just be the case that I just get like, you know, how we've already got the faster LLC? Why would we be creating another one instead of just maybe you just can't add someone in like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDo you have your Social Security number for the US? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe US? I have my UK Social Security. Do I need to be. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAt the very least, you need to have a tax number in the US, which is doable. And we have to do that for every single member in every single country. The US is just not the right place to go through that ordeal. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI don't want access either, to be honest. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then when it comes to actually managing the money in the bank accounts, you need to be in person, and I'm pretty sure show a US ID. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm wondering if the workaround or whatever is how we, like, write it as a part of. Not that we have bylaws or anything like that, but kind of establish the ownership structure with the founders in it that aren't necessarily connected to the registration of the business in the US. Does that make sense? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I'm fine with how it is now. It's just like in the future when, say, the money does start flowing in. I do want my name on documents and stuff, but. Yeah, it's fine. I know it's complicated. We'll figure out. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHenry, would you repeat that? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDo you have your audio turned on? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Can you say that again? Sorry, Henry. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh, I was just saying. Oh, it is fine. Because I know it's all complicated with us all being around the world, but yeah, I said eventually, when a lot of money does start my name on. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd it's important and we've got to figure out how we make that feasible with international. But thank you for bringing that up, and let's do research on it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI mean, there's a lot more urgent matters before that, but, yeah. I got to go pack, guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe see you in 30. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nFor a dev meeting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Audio only. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, maybe. I can probably pack quite quickly, to. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBe honest, but, yeah, we do kind of need you in that meeting. I. Because we need to make some decisions. I'll bring in a demo, and we can go from there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, cool. No worries. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThanks for being here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBye, Henry. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-05 Advocates Meeting - Profit Sharing, Real Estate Projectcleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nLet's give a minute to see if Bartek comes. Okay, so I did something that was quite concerning, if not a little distracting from what I wanted to show you what exactly I wanted to show you guys today, but guiding in that way. I created a sidemap of all the documentation.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet me share all my screens because I created a sitemap from all the documentation. All the documentation as soon as I find it from follow up Boss, which is what we're mainly going to be using in every automation that we do. This is what we're going to use. There you go. There's Bartech connecting to audio forever. Okay, so there's about 200 pages here and it's very digestible, honestly. This is one whole page of documentation. And this is for calls, for example, you can record calls. Man, I keep finding things that is actually really cool. And the one we care about right now is events, tasks. There we go. So tasks, we want to create a new task with some details.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd the details are going to be, hey, it's with this person ID, and we want a due date. And we want a due date time. And with just a person ID and a due date time, we can create a task in follow up boss and also in Google Calendar. So backtrack a couple steps and show you what the CRM actually looks like. So, hey, Bartek, good to have you here, man. We're just starting out and I figured I would start with step one as opposed to step seven. So this is follow up boss. It's been quite, actually quite fun to explore. It's very intuitive. This is just where you have all your people. For a real estate agent, you can divide them into essentially a few core groups, which is people that have already bought a house through you.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMeaning like close people who are currently in the process of buying a house and people who are only cold, that are called cold leads. So we want to keep, real estate agents want to keep track of each group and within each group. For example, somebody buying a house, somebody might just be looking at some stuff, but also there could be another person who already got their mortgage pre approved, meaning if they found a house tomorrow, they would be able to say, I want this, and they will already be approved for how much money they can actually spend, whatever.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSpecifically for a real estate agent, there's going to me, since you see a lot of groups, not just three, you want to have automations that help you with contacting all these people for the clients that we're working with, that we have one here, they have 1300, and it's not even everybody that they're going to upload into the CRM yet. So say 1500 leads of different types that we want to do different things with certain tasks, certain, hey, message this person next week or have lunch with that person next week. So we want to set up tasks that help our real estate agents to keep track of everything they have to do to make the most sales that they can. And what we know is that good customer service leads to good sales. And this is a very tight relationship.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is totally a relationship game. So you have to nurture your relationship with the lead. So going through, just speeding through the other areas of follow up boss, there's an inbox which can include email, it can also include text, and it can also include voicemail. This text part is what we're interested in right now. There are some services that can help you read text and do something with them. Texting Betty is one of those services. Quite expensive, but number one. Well, anyway, quite expensive, but it seems very effective. It's notable that Polo bosses has CRM that was specifically made for real estate agents. And now they have apps from the community that the community made that are specific for these use cases. So these apps tend to be good, tend to be reliable.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI've only tested one so far and we'll see how we actually end up designing this automation. But what we want is something along those lines. I did a test of creating a task manually. This is the task and it said kind of whatever. I set the time for today, 09:40 a.m. Eastern time and then in the calendar, it's synced with my Google calendar. And that's exactly what we want to. So let me show, actually, I showed this last time and we can actually simplify this into a text message. Text message. It's already integrated into follow up boss. So that's great news. That follow up boss can read your messages. We want to create a task based on the content of that message.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo capture some keywords, for example, like the word appointment or the word booked, and we'll think about the technicals, we'll think about the nuances in a second. And then calendar, create a task at certain time, certain topic. It's looking like this. We can delete altogether because that calendar task creation is already synced up. So that's really good news. That's what this is looking like right now. And before I jump into the next thing I want to show you guys, what questions can I answer? Does the CRM make sense? What questions can I answer?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCan you go back to the Figma board?\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right. Can you just re explain this V one again? It's not really clear.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo problem. Thank you. So let me show you an example. What do we want out of what does the client want? What the client wants is that if they're sending a text, say this is on your phone, it'll also get recorded on their platform, which is really good because that means that we can, through the API, go read these messages. So we're wondering, Tulio open phone, what service we're going to use? We can just use the native text platform that is connected to the text on your phone. And I say, hey, let's meet for lunch tomorrow at 05:00 p.m. And I send that text, say that, let's say Dan Corkill is my real estate agent.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we're making this automation for Dan Corkill, meaning that he receives this message and what's going to happen next is a task is going to get created in the CRM. So we need to, number one, be able to read these messages through the API. Number two, evaluate whether there is an appointment to be set or in this case there's lunch tomorrow at 05:00 p.m. So with some either very simple keyword finding, maybe we get into assistance, maybe some simple NLP we have to capture. Oh, an appointment needs to be set. In this case, it's lunch at tomorrow at 05:00 a.m. With Dan. After that, after we evaluate, yes, an appointment needs to be set we're going to create what's called a task within the CRM. A task can be, hey, call this person.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt can also be, okay, in this case, we can see it here. It can be following up, calling them, texting them, showing them a house, or sending them a thank you message. These are all different types of tasks that we want to do. There are two more here that aren't included that the client wants custom, essentially custom actions for which is sending a gift, a physical gift. And the other one is, yeah, actual, like meeting up for lunch. So it would be a task that says meet up for lunch. Once this task gets created, in this case at this time, automatically, Google calendar is already synced up to follow up boss. So if I go to the calendar, I can see this task that I created through a task manually, I can see it connected here.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo it already synced up to their Google Calendar and that's what the client wants from the text messages. From the text messages. Is there an appointment to set, yes or no? In this case, yes, it's lunch. Tomorrow at 05:00 p.m. We want through the API to create a task that says lunch. The topic is lunch and the time is tomorrow at 05:00 p.m. And that will automatically set a Google calendar event for that person as well. So at the end of it, we call it success. When a task got created on follow up Boss and an event got created in Google Calendar, what other clarity can provide.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I understand.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you. Cool. So it's actually pretty straightforward when it comes. If we're talking like the complexity of automations and integrating different systems, follow up boss is very friendly, at least what I've seen so far. We'll actually get into how they integrate everything and failure states, but we'll get there when we get there. What was important to me is for you guys to have the right tools to start. And since this is a relatively straightforward use case, I'm coding this first version. The other thing we want to do is from a spreadsheet, from a CSV, we want to add contact into follow up boss. So you see how I have only, if I go to my people, I have only one contact and it's actually pretty sad. It's the default contact.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's like Palm and MySpace being your first friend, but I have 1300 contacts, or I guess the client has 1300 contacts. We want to upload all of them, meaning we want to migrate from them, dealing with their leads through a spreadsheet, which is actually, how about half of real estate agents do manage their leads. It's just names and numbers on a spreadsheet, which is crazy in the era of CRMs you can do so much, why wouldn't you have it here? Well, one of the big use cases for the referrals we get through our clients are real estate agents who don't even have a CRM set up. Helping them set it up is part of what our job is going to be. Part of that job is migrating the leads in the CSV to follow up boss. That's going to be the second one.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, but are we really going to go through all this documentation and a usual programmer will tell you yes, of course. And it's actually really well documented. Or you can take the route I like to take, which is shortcuts. And I created ridiculous. I created a sitemap for all the documentation in follow up bosses, about 200 different pages, very well documented, but still 200 pages. And with that sitemap, which is every single URL of these references of this API, I then scraped with relevance, I then scraped all of the information within it and I created a knowledge base which says for this URL, no, can I make this bigger? There you go, for this URL, what does the website say? And just scraped everything.Speaker 1\\nSo delete an email template. There are some discussions that people have had in the group. It's like hey, how do I do this? How do I do that? So that's great because now our very own follow up boss, GPT automation assistant shout out to prompt factory for helping with the creation of the system prompt. Now the assistant has access to these API documentation, which is wonderful because the first thing was hey, how, once it loads, yeah, how can I go about creating, please create an automation for task creation from a text message, leveraging the API, including setting up the connection. So the connection to the API and it just goes step by step now. So this is great, this is wonderful. So this is what I mean, that the level of sophistication that we're hitting right now is relatively low. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI did all this in about 2 hours. We actually have to make it work, which is the fun part. We have to, for example, once you've identified a message that requires action, oh well, that's not a trivial task. We have to figure out how to parse the incoming text message and obviously assistant, or just honestly might be an embedding, whatever. This is the basic chat GPT version of it, which is parse the message, and if there are these words in that text message, then return true. Okay, great. Let me go to the notebook. I don't know why I'm showing it on chat GPT. I just wanted to show you this is working just fine. We'll just be cool. Yeah. So we're working on the first automation Jorg, where the real estate agent gets a text message. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe identify whether there's an appointment to set or a task to be done. And then we create a task and an event calendar for the real estate agent to keep track of it. The main pain point, that's something I skipped. The main pain point of this agent was not being able to keep track of all the tasks and all the appointments that they had and really not having the habit of creating Google calendar events in the first place or using Google calendar in the first place. So this is what that chat GPT conversation looks like in code. It's simply, sorry, no, this is for migration. I'm going to backtrack a second. We'll actually make it run. We'll upload our leads that we have, they're actually real estate agents, ironically, into the follow up boss CRM. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd then it's say for the message, hey, can we schedule an appointment for next Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. For this person ID? And then we call this a follow up appointment. These are all things that we would get through the API. Hey, who is this person that is sending this text message? I'm going to pause here. What if we gather all the positive outcomes of the PFA for social media posts? Yo. Yes. In the chat, Bartex says, what if we gather all the positive outcomes of the PFA for social media posts, show for prompting prowess or video them, which is kind of what we're doing right now. We're saying like, hey, look what we did with PFA. It was fast. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, so the reason I want to pause right now, sometimes I got a little fast and I just want to make sure that everyone's with me in case there's questions. The next step is actually making this work. We have the code, let's connect to the CRM. I have the API key. And we make it work. We need some ideas for how to parse incoming texts when the migration. We can organize this a little bit. And then we have set up tasks from text message. We need some ideas for how to parse, say the sentence, meet, add, whatever, eater restaurant next week, next Monday at 05:00 p.m. We need to be able to create a task of a bad message. What's the thing? Well, it hasn't been confirmed. We just received the message. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOne of the nuances that we'll have to deal with is the client actually answers yes, then set up the task so we can't set up the task prematurely or else it will be a mess. Like, well, what if it changed to the restaurant? What if it's not Monday by Tuesday? One that's number one. And example one is meta, which is multiple messages. Sample one is what happens if there are multiple messages. Example two, triggers for the automation. Sure, we can even create a sophisticated assistant, but what happens if the task, which actually the first example that she gave us is ready for, let's say prospect X is ready for pre approval. And pre approval refers to a mortgage. Very quickly. A mortgage is how much money will you be. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nA pre approval is how much money will you be allowed to spend once you decide on a house. So based on the money you're allowed to spend is which houses you are able to even see. So the real estate agent needs this information to then know, oh, I can show them this house, oh no, that house is too expensive. They're not approved for that price. And this is also a task. This is a task that might not have a date and a time or even a very clear oh, I'm meeting with a person. But it is a task that needs to get done. Task that needs to get done. And she gave us a default, which is the default date and time is 09:00 a.m. The next day. Okay, wonderful, great. So we have two examples here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNumber one, what if it's multiple messages that require parsing and require making decisions, require guiding an agent, whatever we might implement to say, oh, there's a task to be done here, but there hasn't been any confirmation. So is there a task to be done? Is there confirmation? And this task may or may not be an appointment. Is it even a task that needs confirmation? Meeting up with someone needs confirmation. Just hey, we have to check. This document doesn't need confirmation. It's just something that we need to create a task for that will go in their calendar. 09:00 a.m. The next day. This can be a lot. There are going to be other examples. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo let's pause here again, and I'd love to hear some ideas as to what might be a good approach, NLP approach, agents approach, or basic keyword search that we can come up with. Has anybody worked on something similar to this before? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think we need to have AI for that. Definitely. Because what if they say no or want to reschedule or something? I've got to go finish packing and then I'm flying. Is there anything else you want to show me? Tell me. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. So I'll be sharing this with you guys, this GPT with you and you can go play, you can go ask you questions. The main thing that we're trying to solve right now, the migration I think is going to be relatively straightforward. The main thing that we want to solve right now is setting up tasks from text message. So with the API and I'll share this conversation with you guys too. Creator update. No, this is the other one. Full automation create task in follow up boss. And it has the steps, the description we would need. As it says here, you might need to adjust the payload according to your specific requirements. We need a time and a date, right. We know what the default is so it's here. We need a due date, et cetera. That's for text message. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo to do just 1 second, Henry. To do actually test output from the GPT, set up an assistant, let's call it assistant API and we might have other uses for it down the line. Set up an assistant API for text message parsing and automation trigger. Figure out what that looks like in prompt. And else, what else? Once we create the task, the Google calendar event should be created automatically. That's something we're going to test. Yes. One last thing. So two minutes. Action plans. Action plans are going to be series of tasks that will be triggered automatically. So there's an open house? An open house is. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm a realtor and I want people to come see this new house that I want to sell and I'll set up a day where people can come and I can give the tour of the house to the 30 people that show up as opposed to doing 30 individual tours, which is no. So open houses are for, that are for. Hey, there's a new house here people might be interested in. It's beautiful. It's decent price. Let's show it. I'm back. Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah. Screen. I think I said the words I wanted to say. The difference between action plans and tasks is that tasks we're gonna set up, they're gonna get triggered from text messages and action plans are already going to be set up once a lead comes into the CRM. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo new person went to the open house, their email gets put in, they get in the CRM and they'll receive automatic messages emails, reminders, events based on the action plans that we're going to set up on the back end and we'll get to action plans. I want us to get familiarized with the API and we'll also get the actual action plans from our clients, Devin. So that is not extreme urgency. What is important right now is getting familiarized with the API. Unfortunately, we have a GPT for that. Number two, looking at different examples that we need to test for reliability. So as we talked, Bartech test driven development, and I'd love your guidance on how to go about that. That goes beyond just having two examples. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd number three, the prompt for the assistant to be able to parse and capture the requirement of oh, we need to set up a task correctly. The assistant will probably need to speak in JSON. So that's a plus for using the assistant API. Let's go step by step. We need to get familiarized. We can do that in our own time. We need to create examples and we need to set up the assistant. Let's look at the assistant first and then we'll look at examples. Or would the other way around make more sense? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think examples, Pierce examples. If you want to test driven development, then yeah, examples. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you for keeping me to what I just said 10 seconds ago. Awesome examples. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. And then it will be also even not thinking from a test driven development point of view, it will be easier to work with PFA on the prompt when we have examples already set up. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo true. Oh my God. Of course you can just give them the examples and it'll do what it needs. Hey, there's one thing that I have not, I'm not going to ask right now. JSon mode on assistance. We can look at that later. Okay, samples. Let's do five examples. We can include two counter examples as well. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou know what, copy this cell to PFA and ask it to make more examples. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSure. Yes. Let's get there for better data. I just wanted to go through my brain because we talked. I'm speaking to the page directly, who's behind me. Just so you know, I'm not talking to the wall. We sat with Devin for 2 hours. What are other things that came up regarding needing to set this up as a task or as a calendar event? Real estate agent. There's new prospects. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt's managing the tasks that like you said. Hey, I need this pre approval form by tomorrow. Hey, are you good for our meeting at 03:00 p.m.? Tomorrow? Yes or no? And these are really. We spent 2 hours talking with her just about client relationships. We didn't even go into any of the other process aspects of her business, which could be a whole other thing. We talked about her touch points, and what makes her a really cool first client for faster eyes is that she's excited about this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd she has some of the puzzle pieces in play, but it's a matter of connecting them. So one thing that she does that's really important for referrals and client loyalty and touch points is, for example, she'll send out quarterly gift baskets to every realtor in her database. Ideally, she doesn't have touch anything. And every quarter, any person in her CRM that is tagged as a realtor the end of quarter hits it automates a trigger that sends a message to another company that she already is working with that puts together the gift baskets and mails them out. So the automation we would set up would involve extracting the names, the addresses, and the contact info of all the current realtors that are tagged and sending it over to the company she's working with to arrange the gift basket. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nShe also has another company she works with that will do handwritten notes or just kind of thank you card, that kind of thing. Depending on where a client might be in their action plan. A client gets the settlement day. So then in follow up boss, when that action happens, okay, it's settlement day. There's an automation that then triggers, okay, we need to send this handwritten card to this client. Again, she's already working with this company. It's really about integrating that system. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIntegrating. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd she spends a lot of time on calls on her. Mean, the simple automation of text to Google calendar event or meeting is simple, but it saves her so much time of them having to go into her phone, create the Google calendar events at the time. Yada yada yada. And it just does it for her. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, I'm pulling back up my notes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe gift baskets, the handwritten letters. Then as scheduled. Okay, I'm going to take RtEx wise advice, not throw this into. I came up with one counterexample which was, oh, the prospect got approved for a mortgage. So that wouldn't really require an action, a task to be set. It might further down the line we might want to trigger an action plan. We might want to trigger, oh, now send them this email and then two days later send them this reminder email so we can move the process forward. But it's not a, right now I need to set up an appointment or a task to do so we'll leave it at there for now and that might change in the future, but for now, that is one of the counterexamples that we're looking at. So help me complete. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWait, no, I literally just did a thing here with PFA. Yeah, no, wait. Where is it? Hello, boss. Yes, there we go. Okay, wonderful. Oh yeah. I asked in different approaches for triggering the task. So regular expression. Sure. Natural language processing. We're not going to go that way. Classifiers. Oh, we need to train a model. That's what JGBT is, man. All these NLP tasks are just like embeddings based now. It's crazy. Anyway, these are all old. And it's funny because LLMs is not in there. Okay, we need to create examples to teach a model when an appointment task needs to be set up. Help us fill these out. Yes. Sample one, message one. Then example one, message two. Yes. Then set up the task. Is there a task to be done? Is there confirmation even needed? Using these guiding questions. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIs there a task to be done? Is there confirmation, is there a task to be done? Or appointment to set? Is there confirmation, is confirmation needed? Is there explicit confirmation if needed. Okay. Requires action. Yes, prospect X is ready for mortgage pre approval task that needs to get done. Default with default date and time. 09:00 a.m. The next day. That's probably unnecessary here. Okay, let's see. I it reason the first message proposes a meeting with a specific date and time. And the second message confirms the appointment. Love it. Of course we need reasons. The message indicates a task, mortgage pre approval that needs to be initiated for the prospect. Looking at the counter example, prospect X was approved for mortgage. The message takes a completed action rather than requesting a new task or appointment to be set. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, backtracking sample three, a message that requires action but does not explicitly mention an appointment or task. Can you call prospect Y to discuss listing their house? Fair. There's a question mark, but that doesn't feel like a question. Like if Kim sends this to Devon, she's not asking a question. An implicit task to call and discuss. Great, wonderful. Great job on closing the deal with prospect Z. Requires action. No, this message is, I think the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nExample tree is like out of the scope of this initial automation we're doing, because we're doing four meetings. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I would keep it simple because it's free. Let's keep it simple, let's deliver it fast, and let's not go to the, you can do that in version two. Yeah, let's say I would keep the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMessage will not only be for meetings, the explicit ask was, hey, if there's a task, I need to have it in my calendar. And in this case, all right, this is a task kind of like this one prospect as it's ready for mortgage pre approval. And that is a task that needs to get done. If we're talking only this, I see the straightforward let's have it working. At the very least, let's have a prototype working. Do you feel like ideally we're showing this kind of like in 24 hours that we get at least a few examples working is what I mean. And we would want to show kind of exactly these examples. Right. So these examples would fuel the quality of our essentially closing sales call tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. Are you doing the live presentation or showing screenshots or video or something like that? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, I'll share videos screenshot. We don't want anything going awry and we know how live stuff goes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut anyways, for now, the examples that resonate the most and are easily replicable because this example three could be vague sometimes. And let's not promise that early on, let's say it will be, let's say next iteration or something like that, unless it's really needed and explicitly say like, no. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I hear what you're saying. I. Okay, we're saying makes a lot of sense. The example that she gave us explicitly is, hey, if there's someone ready for mortgage pre approval, put it as a task, this would be like extra. So yes, let's not promise that. Maybe it'd be like, hey, would this functionality be also something you're interested in, that you get a message from your partner, from your business partner and it's like, hey, can you call this prospect and making sure that gets scheduled too? But yes, that is a good point. So if we're cleaning this up, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut I will be careful with telling that because I'm not saying this example won't work. I think this could work. I see it working. But if she thinks like, okay, they can do also this, then what others can do, and it might later might come up with some examples that could be harder to achieve. So let's say we can have that as a bonus, but let's bring a little education about LLMs and about randomness and stuff that we see it as a good potential to have more stuff. But let's take this in mind that it might not work in more complex. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMore complex that I think is a very good thing to be aware of. So we'll keep the conversation then to what we know we can do, number one, which is what they asked for. And then kind of like an open floor of like, what else can you guys come up with? There are some that might be more difficult to implement given that LLMs work this way and that way, so we can come back next time and see which ones are feasible to implement. Would that make sense? Or not even open it up. They're going to have more ideas. That's the thing. It'd be like we can take these ideas back to our dev team and then evaluate which ones are actually feasible. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, so these are this old and now we have these requires action. Yes, no and no. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat you could do to have more of those, more variants of those examples. We want to show fears. We could just say, give me more examples for variants of example one or two or one end. Got you. I would say every possible variance so we can see all the ways it could go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, it has no limits. We can just ask it for. Okay, so we'll pause that here. I'll integrate that back. It is 330 a m for me, so I only have so much fuel left, but definitely some left. So let's go through some checklist stuff first. Number one, let me share the conversation with you guys with this GPT, we're going to create a new channel for real estate client Kuba. I will not forget the personalized outreach system and we will continue with that. The time sensitivity on this kind of requires so much of our attention and we're definitely still going forward with the outreach system. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I totally understand. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, so that's number one, sharing this conversation. Number two, sharing the assistant initial conversation with follow up boss GPT about the API migrating leads to CRM from CSV to CRM. And then there's the other one we talked about, which is setting appointment from text message. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNow can you also share with me the chat that you created this prompt with PFA? Yes, if it's successful, then that's a good case study. And I would like if you can share me some more of examples, you find it useful, that will be great. So I would try to aggregate that for some content. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAlso, do we have a content team in faster eyes or it's just like marketing doing content or how that looks? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe are focusing on video and page is our engine and our everything for marketing right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm also thinking that maybe we could do some recruiting for fasterized like some people. For example, I had this training groups last year, I was just recruiting people from Facebook, not say free employees. But kind of, you can sort of have people who just want to learn and they will join you and just kind of do stuff for learning and then maybe be an employee if they are already good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou mean when it comes to content? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI mean when it comes to everything. I think we could use more people everywhere. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI agree. Managing those people tends to be very time consuming. However, if it's a win, I'm all for it, man. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause definitely I'm thinking fears of content. Definitely. We need to spread the world more and post way more content. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh yes we do. So introduce us, bring them in. Let's have a conversation. Let them join the discord. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI mean, I don't have people ready yet. I would start looking for them. So we can maybe discuss that later how we want to plan that out. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFor now, you and I, let's connect. And we need more video for PFA. I think that's going to be one of our best content generators. I'm working with Opus to put some video out and also there will be more info coming on podcast hour, which is where we're going to get a lot of our video content from. So stay tuned or else come to the gen exec tomorrow and we're going to talk about that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think we can also make a podcast, like pasteurized podcast. Or maybe invite somebody, like networking with someone and then have some kind of call. I don't know. I'm just thinking out of my head now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat was that? Sorry, I missed it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm thinking that we could also make a podcast, either ourselves as a team, or invite somebody from outside, like some, I don't know, subject matter expert or whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWe are on the same brainwaves, Bartech. Yes, 100%. And yeah, dual purpose, because we can post full on podcast hours of us talking about different topics, products, PFA. My 03:00 a.m. Brain isn't working, but shout out to PFA. Let's talk about PFA. And we can use the longer versions as short video content that can go out on various platforms. That's the direction we're going. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYep. So swimming up, you want to connect separately or on the gen exec tomorrow? Or both? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nProbably both. Gen exec will be a lot of general updates and explaining what podcast hour is and get some ideas going for it. And I think if you and I get on video again the same way we did last time, and we can talk more about use cases, I'm guessing video content from that will be most helpful. So Alejo will probably need to take a few minutes and get in front of a video camera and just say, hey, so I used PFA and I did this and these are some of my results I think will be the best way to get you those testimonials. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI agree. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd also I think we have two videos to extract a short from. Like the first try of PFA when ale make the transcript prompt. That's definitely great for content. We were all excited. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhich one? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe excitement for the non vocal stuff. This one. Yeah, that will be perfect. And I think you didn't show quite the chat. So maybe we can do separately today example. But I think we had a call, another dev call at some point back then where we used the PFA, but I don't remember exactly when that was. So I don't know if you guys can find it. But yeah, let's also record some new content. I'm also thinking about because I'm still kind of trying to get myself to make this swarm thing and I'm trying to document the journey, like the dev journey, like how I come up with the stuff and things like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's figure out how we can best support you in documenting that journey. If it's like showing us the updates once a week and that's the video, that's something that helps me personally. If I have somebody listening, it's much easier for me to say, oh, this is what I did this week and this is what I want to show. This is the progress. This is why, this is why I made that decision and not this one. Might not work for everybody. It might be like your own time, your own space that works best, but rely on us for recording and documenting any content. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI noticed that also this helps me to, instead of just me talking like a loom recording or something, it's better to have a conversation. It's more natural. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. It comes out more organic. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI feel that sometimes it's hard to just stare into a camera and talk. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. But it's also hard to talk into a group of people. Hey, Kuba, I wanted to quickly check in on you and see if anything has changed from when we talked Friday. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI updated everything. Like I've updated you to the GitHub. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAwesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI corrected the prompts for the email, my stocking crash. We got a limits error, so I fixed that also. And John, do I fixed it also? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, and how did we fix that? How do you fix the limiter? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, it's actually the prompt from the email agents. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I have a question regarding this project. I want to start, can you explain that confirmation part? Because it is okay. Once the tax. Once created tax? Yeah, you said we need a confirmation. Again, I don't really understand. Why do we need the confirmation? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. So is your question regarding the example of let's meet tomorrow at 05:00 p.m. And the confirmation is yes. Okay, so let's say we do create the event, the task, when that message gets received, let's meet tomorrow at 05:00 p.m.. Whatever, and we create the task. But the answer to that question is, no, I can't at that time. Let's do a different time. But we already created the task, so that would be an issue. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo there are some messages for which we'll need confirmation. So keeping a thread of the messages, even just like the last four messages, last five messages, would be very useful. We want to avoid any false positives. We want to avoid any creating any tasks that weren't confirmed or that shouldn't have been created. The main thing we want to avoid are false negatives that if a task needed to be created, that it actually gets created. The worst case scenario is that a task needs to be created and it doesn't get created. That's the first worst case scenario that we want to avoid. That's our priority. Which what you're saying in that way would actually prevent false negatives because even just getting the question without the confirmation would create an event. But it's a thin line that we're treading. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd these questions are very useful that you're asking are very useful because there's a lot of failure states that we need to avoid. So having PFA is like, hey, make more examples is going to be a great way to avoid that. And on Tuesday, hopefully we get more real examples, not only pre approvals and lunches, it's also this and that, and we can also create variations for that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Could you send me a link to the notebook? Because I think I'm seeing the right one, but I'm not sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. I uploaded the right one to the GitHub. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGitHub, that's right. You said that. Thank you. Okay, wonderful. Do you have any questions for me, ma'am? Anything I can help with? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo, nothing for now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. I'll check out the. There we go. I'll check out the personalized outreach system update and back to you tool the agent would use so we can keep talking later, brother. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, bro. Goodbye, guys. Bye, guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSee you soon. Bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-05 Dev Meeting - Follow Up Boss Automations, FUB GPT, API, CRM, starting code and ideas.mp3cleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nI wanted to get into the project. Yeah, let's roll.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, let's do it.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo your message, and I'm not going to make you pick one. You're welcome to do both. You're welcome to do more Variety. It's all about initiative. I just don't want to overload anyone. However, if you have the capacities, like, yes, let's collaborate on both.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's do both.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLet's do all of it. We won't have a shortage of projects counting three right now, which is the personalized outreach system, the knowledge base builder, which I'm trying to finish a prototype for, so then we can proceed to productionizing. And then number three, real estate, which this week obviously deserves high priority.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I think it's better I should focus only my skus in Rag because I need it in the long run, but I can. Just checking up on what you guys are doing on this project here.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, that sounds great. Yeah, absolutely. That makes sense. And I'm all for skill specialization.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, so great segue for where Paige and I are just coming from. We just came from an event about generative AI, and one of the speakers was the product design guy from relevance AI, and he's actually the one that created the sales agent.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo that is definitely the avenue we're going with. That's the personalized outreach system. That's also the knowledge base builder.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe second category is new features for products because of AI, and then it's whole new services because of AI.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe second category is new features for products because of AI, and then it's whole new services because of AI. And we're in that sort of second to third that new features to things, to systems, but also new products based around AI.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo that was another question that I got answered by one of the speakers. So how do we ensure privacy and that nothing ever leaves our ecosystem that OpenAI never reads any of the messages or the private information that people send about the houses that they want to buy or how much money they got.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLive events is where it's at. Not only for community, not only for knowing people in the space, not only for gaining information, but for thinking of new questions that are coming up.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat being said, right now we have work to do. So let's get to work.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWhat questions or clarity can I answer before we dive in?\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI was working on the migration from CSV from a spreadsheet to the CRM and I was having some authentication errors. This is not quite the priority right now, though. We will need to solve it. Looked at the docs and there was no straightforward answer. So we'll get around to that. What we're working on right now is the setup task from text message. We have the examples.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI mean, to make the prompt sort of mirroring the agent role, the real human that is getting the phone, the texting, so the AI will get the context of who is this and who make those appointments or whatever the event will be. Yeah, so we will have context.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo could you help me with two things right now? Number one, creating the initial prompt that we can use to test this and we can show it the examples and all this stuff.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo before I do that, going back to the first question, should we require confirmation, some affirmation? It'll definitely help with reliability, which is one of the, we don't want any false positives.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think we can have like if the person agree, then make an event. So if the sentiment is person agreed, then the trigger happens.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nJust trying to be thorough here.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nPosted in the real estate client.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I'm thinking I could use also if you could write a sentence about the role, like stating the exact role.Speaker 3\\nUse cases auto assistant scheduler. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, so I'm going to. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis context. Auto scheduler assistant purpose for real estate agents. So analyze incoming text messages and determine if an appointment needs to be set. Analyze text message conversation. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, great. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere it is. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCheck the real estate clients chat. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe're back here, we're setting up an. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAgent, and I know that we have. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSetting up an agent, which I should definitely know by heart, but I don't. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo let's find it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nReplicate this is solutions. Of course. There we go. No, this one didn't have an agent in it. What I do remember, Bartek, do you. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nRemember by heart how to create an. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAgent with an assistant API? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think in replica to have a template for that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou do? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think there is something like that. There is definitely a template for OpenAI GPT call through API. Yeah, that should be also assistant. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, there we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, guess what if I just learned fusion prompting through this example. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNice. That's funny. System file client files create. Yes, it's creating. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo you want to trigger the follow up boss through the assistance actions. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI was thinking about it. The other option, which makes no sense, is to have the assistant output a specific keyword to then trigger the function. And we would have to say if assistant says yes, or if output is yes, then we would have to ask the assistant for the details of the. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAppointment that needs to be set. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt just feels way more clunky than giving the assistant the function. And it can figure out, is there a time, is there a date, is there a place, and just run the function itself. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I think so. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWe are adding some stochasticity into it, but we're at the point where we can probably trust that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'd be very surprised if weren't able to. Okay, well, this is the function. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think it's good then because I was wondering because the prompt is having the follow up boss kind of trigger in it. But I guess if we have the assistant with action, then it will work just fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOh, you're saying that the prompt says, I got confused. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWould you say that one more time? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe prompt have the trigger kind of function in it for the follow up. Boss. Maybe I'll just throw it into the discord because I had to make a file for it, though I probably put them later in the GitHub. For now it's only one. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, we're going to have versioning with that, man, because it's going to get very messy very quickly. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAirtable, I always use vs code for the prompts, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nJust having a different file. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd Kuba, we'll talk about modularizing your code. When it was on notebooks, it was easier to keep track of it. Now that it's one all big file with like 600 lines of code in GitHub, it's much harder. But what you did in notebooks, it's great. It's very easy to follow. We'll have to figure out how we match both those things like version control through GitHub, while also having that sort of step by step feel where we can test something. It breaks, we know where to look. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd all that stuff. So for main py, we want client keeps. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo for now I think that this prompt will be all right since we don't have the rug yet. So we try the fish prompting first and we'll see how that goes. Yeah, drop the repo in the discord. Definitely add more examples. I think you could take those two example lines from the prompt and have them into, I don't know if you're showing a presentation deck or whatever, you can show them to the client and let them ask them if they see more affirmative replies or keywords. Use our keywords for the keywords related to appointments there in the prompts. And also there are the affirmative replies. So as usual, tell the client that the more the better. Maybe they want to take that home or they want to answer on the call, whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. If a response confirms an appointment. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOh, it just learned fusion prompting. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's funny. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt's very funny. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou see the prompt? Yeah, it's never the official prompting before. I think it was because of I prompted it with the examples. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, right. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHow can I look at the markdown? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThere we go. Okay, so now I'm going back and in the assistant, the whole thing is assistant prompt system prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, and by the way, I have first version of the upwork system, so we can plug the API in there and have it running all the way around. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI would like to have people who want to do upwork maybe on the call, like make an upwork team and stuff. And then because I imagine this. We got that rolling whole day, and we just catch all the best jobs to the to airtable and then have somebody, let's say we have four people in there. So every 3 hours one of those people just go and check it. And then, okay, we have cool project in here. I write proposal. I tell the team, okay, I wrote proposal. Okay, you'll hear it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd then if we get answer, we get a call and we start the project. What are you guessing? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMakes sense, bro. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAwesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nVertech. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut on the other hand, I'm now second guessing if we have the people for that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nIf we have what? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf we have people, if we have capacity. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nIf you offer money, people will do the work. So have the projects first and have the problem of low capacity later. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, but I'm also talking about managing the stuff. Somebody needs to still look at those offers, make the proposals, because AI proposal won't get you a job. I already experienced that. So you need to really use your user brain to write. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI see. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay, well, let's go step by step. Let's look at that V one together and we can go from there. Because you do have another great brain for that, Zach. For something like a proposal and for just churning them. So let's talk about it later. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor identifying messages that require action. That require an action. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo it will know that it can call. Okay, could you help me with jumping into the notebook and setting up the tool? The tool is going to be the function create task. The function is down here below. I just don't remember the syntax for creating a function call. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll right, I was reading the prompt. Yeah, I also don't know that by HUD. We will have to check it somewhere. I think I got a better prompt, by the way, because I ordered PFA to make it only task classifier prompt rather than do everything. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWell, then show it the code here. I'll wait. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe payload also needs to include the time of thing, so give me a second and I can share with you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe second prompt also makes category and urgency. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWhat did you say, kuba? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI heard you guys talking about like a templates for function calling, right? Yeah, I think I have something. Let me share. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOh yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAwesome. Thanks, man. Wouldn't it be tasked? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOh, activities is tasked. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think you could call, if you have in the sidebar some kind of GPT that does open up a schema, you could just call a mansion in here and have it in the schema. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCan you show me what you mean? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI mean, there is those GPTs you can just search them on the store and those GPTs, some of them like open up schema creator or whatever. And then with the mention thing you can use your chat that you were just showing second before with this assistant you made and call the open episode to make you the function. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOf course you can. Oh my God, that's such a good idea, dude. Okay. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMy brain unlocked when I started using mentions for the PFA and now I see the use case. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOh that's awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWant to do date? Nice. Required. This is something we want. The default is going to be tomorrow 09:00 a.m. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo say yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGenerate. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYou want to generate daytime? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhich daytime? For tomorrow at 09:00 a.m. Daytime today you add plus one and then you say 09:00 a.m.. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nMichelle. Yeah, that's awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBig time now plus one. Okay, cool. That works. Nice. So we know that is tomorrow. That means tomorrow at 09:00 a.m. So then we're using this to create a task and due date is going. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nTo be by default going to be tomorrow at 09:00 a.m. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo death default time tomorrow 09:00 a.m. Description is going to be description and then person Id. Is going to be person Id. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThis task is just going to be a task. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe just want to create a task. Okay, so then this works. These are the fields we can use. This is the assistant and you guys sent something. Awesome. Student custom function. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOne of my questions is where do I. Never mind, I see it. Thanks. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo as I am creating, so for. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThe assistance API, does that fall under tools? Does that fall under like this? Then we're going to have some required. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd some non required. So we have person type description. Due date type is just going to be task. We can say, hey, this is always type is going to be description. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSome kind of AI assistant in this collab. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWhat do you mean? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI see something like colab AI in the right side. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOh yeah. Just below this code for me. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, I didn't even try it but I guess we can try create an. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAssistant using the assistant API. Agent using assistance API with data for system. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI have a strong feeling that google is not trying to promote OpenAI's code. This is not the right code. This is not the right function call. This is the old version. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo that's that. Let's see it. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nTotally caught the prompt though. Yay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is the right one. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nBut it just copied the code from. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nUp here so that doesn't count. Let me change with a function call to. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, I just copying the code that we just used. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, well, that didn't quite work. It's just copying the code over and overload. Not quite. Okay, where were we? Send something to the group that something was the function. So what we need to do is say a, this is not students custom function, but it's actually called create task. F u b. Custom function type retrieval type function. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOh, I remember this type function. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCall. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI remember one of these that had. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nActual function that did some math on chat function. Yeah, we would probably need to repeat this as well that we're running. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nHey, there's a chat. We need to get the thread id if it doesn't exist, if it's a new conversation. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, we'll see what this looks like in practice because I'm not sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWhat we know is that there's a thread that gets created with a certain thread ID. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nContent is going to be user input. Great. So we have a message, we have a thread ID, and. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nGuys, we gotta. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nJump off for 15 minutes. You still be in this call or you're just finishing? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWe need to finish the sales deck, so we will definitely continue. And if you can help me with tuning. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe prompt, I already put second version in the same repo. There is the sort of more focused on task classifier thing, right? So you can check those two, how they work. And later maybe after your conversation with the client, after we get more of those keywords, of those affirmative replies and examples of the messages themselves, then I think we can go really and test those prompts against each other, either in prompt or. I have also like two or three tools for testing to check out and I don't have time for them. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay, let's stick with prompt foo then. Let's stick with what works and what we know. And maybe that's what we do. A small workshop out of which is great content. It's like, hey, testing your LLM is super hard. This is something that makes it easier. And this is how we made it to build an actual product for a client. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBoom. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nVideo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, that's great. Although I think prompt for it's a bit clunky, but yeah, we can definitely go over that and then later go over some muting. That is even better. Yeah, sounds great. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nNow we're thinking of like the second version of the video. Great, wonderful. We'll get to all of it. Just got to keep grinding. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI'm going to make this custom function and then I'm going to go focus on finishing the sales deck with Paige, who's doing the grunt of the work for that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThank you, Paige. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo I'll see you, Bartek. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLater. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nKuba, I will see you later. Connect soon. Tomorrow. My tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAbout pfa self. Bartech. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd also, let's schedule the upwork thing to go over that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, good. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nAwesome. I will send you two documents that I would like us to start. We're going to have a whole knowledge base. All the documents. There's two documents that I'd like us to start being able to do rag on. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, cool. I said, should we catch up, like, later today to talk about it? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo later today means tomorrow for me. I could do after the business call at 10:00 a.m. Our time, 11 hours from now. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\n11 hours. That will be okay. Yeah, it works. I'll be awake. I'll still be awake by that time. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay. Or we can start async and we connect tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right. Same time tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI will confirm the time, but let's meet, you and I, and we can talk. There's a couple of things I'd like to show you and we could get to work on. I didn't even tell you what it was. The knowledge base builder. So essentially getting to work on the knowledge base builder so we can finally have an assistant that can help us through so much of this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, that's all. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThere's a couple of documents that I'd like to start on, so I'll send them to you, and you can look at that, and we'll go from there. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, cool. We'll catch up tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nCatch up tomorrow then. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBye, then. Cool. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-05 Dev Meeting - Follow Up Boss text automation Assistant Promptscleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nGuys come together to make this happen. So my goal is to give you all these ideas and you guys are to implement it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'll be recording this so we make sure we capture absolutely everything. We're also taking notes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd we can all have access to the recording. Okay, so you mentioned action plans. Listing them. Listing them with you and David and.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. So Mary Gold, gifting. Are there any other external companies that you're working with to send out gifts or notes or cards? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSandra has two etsy accounts that we're working with so we can link up with her to get those accounts to kind know, trigger that.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nMore like action plans. There's like people who had previous app intakes. We'll change all of them to leads and then create an action plan to send out emails to see, I guess, if they're in the market for purchasing or still interested. I guess we could do that with the pre approved as well, just to change their stage so it'll automatically trigger those action plans. I guess with the past clients just making sure that we have the correct closing date. And also you wanted to track birthday, so if you wanted to send something for a birthday, we can.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBirthdays are a good for, I think really we'll just do realtor birthdays as far as just a gift being sent.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou can send the recordings of the Zoom calls afterwards. Perfect. Thank you.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo I think a key thing too is what I will do for all of you guys is I will list out this action plan because there's going to be a bunch of them, right? There's going to be like a credit repair one, an open house one, a realtor one, a just closed one. So I will list them all out and then we'll all work together to create these action plans.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe're just going over basically how all three of them, I guess four of them, Paige and Lejo, you guys are one, how all of them are going together. There you are. To create the action plans and follow up offs.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe approval is coming in April. I'll try to push it a little bit earlier. And David, that's an update for you too. To get our emails talking with movement has to go through and approve everything. So we're waiting on that. But in the meantime, we really can set up all of these action plans and everything.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nA note in there that we've talked with some experts on this. Let me simplify. We figured out privacy of data and making sure that data never leaves wherever we put it, that no company can ever read it, and that it leaves even the US physically, that the data never leaves the US. And we're talking with someone to figure out the details. But we got confirmation possible. That is very doable.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. So that would be out of our control. What it is in our control is, say, email gets received. What do we do with that email? And maybe deserves setting a task or a Google calendar appointment for a pre approval that we would make sure that no private data or no data at all ever leaves our control. No other whatever. It's integrated with follow up boss. That would be based on their.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPerfect, perfect. Ok. And I think we can also start as a little simple step of when a client gets imported into follow up boss, as a under contract client, they have a close date, and that close date should essentially go in follow up boss. But then it should go on my calendar or Kim's calendar, depending whose client it is. So that's like a simple thing that we need done, right, Kim?\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd that will be tagged in follow up boss. As far as who owns that client, my separate data.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut everything we're talking about and doing we're both going to use. And that's when Sandra, I don't know if she can hear us or not, but she will create. Here's this email template. She'll add our signature with that email template.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe other question I had, and this is, I guess, to anyone, is there a way? And this also might be a movement question. KK, when we get an application coming into blend, how do we get it to automatically go over to follow up.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nKim. So, you know, whenever we say integration, we mean one app talking to another. Zapier facilitates one app talking to the other apps. So email to blend to follow up boss would be that communication. I don't see initially why it wouldn't be doable. I haven't used blend, so we can dig into that as well.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's the way it's going to have to go, just because of how Blen is working through movement at the moment.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMortgage director and PCL are the same platform. Blend is a different platform. So when an application comes in, for your clarity, it goes into our blend system. It has to be humanly touched to move it over to our PCL system or mortgage director, which is where we work out of and where everything gets done.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think that's really the main idea here, is just to start to create these action plans and make them work.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd the other thing that we chatted about was looking at. I know right now, the email to Google calendar is tricky because of. We're waiting on approval for follow up boss. But the text to Google Calendar is what we've been working on. So you receive a text and either maybe it's like, hey, we need this pre approval, blah blah. Okay, I'll send the pre approval letter tomorrow. That would trigger confirmation of a task that then goes to follow up boss. Because follow up boss can talk to Google Calendar. So it creates event in the Google calendar.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt can also talk to Outlook, right?\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. Once you connect your accounts.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLike that automated that's also been working on? And the thought process is that whatever you're messaging, there's probably going to be a confirmation like either yes or no. So meet with you at 05:30 p.m. That confirmation would trigger the automation because what you don't want is all these weird calendar events getting created that aren't actually real or confirmed.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo text confirmation, a follow up boss task gets created and then a Google calendar event gets created. What that looks like in practice is, hey, can we hop on a call tomorrow at 03:00 p.m.. Yes, you Ben. So task gets created, Google calendar event gets created, and these are the details. These details is what on the AI side we implement. Right. So can you extract every detail that it's important. Hey, we got you now. Okay, wonderful.Speaker 2\\nDiscuss pre approval for Amy. Finally, when do we not need a trigger? And these are very important to be very thorough on. Got the pre approval letter for Carl. Thanks. Woohoo. You got it. No action, no action needed. Where AI captures this. Messages, confirmation of receipts, there's no action to trigger. And in this case, so happy Jen settled. Great work. Thank you. Messages, congratulatory statement. That's no action triggered. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo then the name Jane Keys. So let's say Greg says, hey, I want to meet you at the bar. It's personal. If he's not in my follow up, boss, that's not as a name, that's not going to be registering. Just trying to figure out how we maneuver through that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, definitely maneuverable. Let's look at the cases. Maybe there are some names, maybe it's people in the family and we can tag those to be don't do anything if these people send a message, that is very doable. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd looking at some other cases, because these are some that we talked about, but there are only a few cases here. So getting some examples from you guys of, oh, here's an example of a meeting somewhere or meeting for a certain event. This would need a confirmation or this trigger for an event. This would not. Getting some of those examples is going to make this as robust as possible. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGot it. So you're going to put the rules behind the scenes based on what we're giving you? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHere's a good example. Literally today I received a client. She emailed in to get pre approved. I said, awesome, sounds good. I asked her, are you available for a call today or tomorrow to discuss goals and plans for next home? And she emailed me back. Thanks, Devin. Is 530 this evening too late for you? And I emailed her back. I said, 530 works great. So would that 530 get triggered to follow up? Boss, for a task, it would have to go in there, and then it would go to my calendar saying, I have a call with. Would it pick up the client's name as well? Because it's from Megan Landy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYep. It would pick up the task. The time. There was a time sort of discussion there. It would pick up the right time. This is about giving it the right examples so it can generalize. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGo ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. So if we give that example, and then we make up one variation of that example, another discussion of, hey, not this time. Not that time. There's a sort of a back and forth, and then there's a confirmation. We're showing the system. Hey, here are some examples. Now, when a new one comes in, you know how to deal with it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGot it. So we got one today, again, came from Brooke at Eagle title. It was a picture of an invitation beneath it, the link. I hit on the link and I had to go through and accept it with my name. And that's on my text. Yes. To Marilyn day. It has the date and time. Will it pick stuff like that up? I can forward that text on to you. So you see what I'm talking about? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAre the date and time in the link as well or just shown on the. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nChecking onto you right now? Age. This doesn't happen a lot, but it does happen. Why don't I have your phone? I have your phone number. Pa. There it is. Okay. This is the first text I got. Then right after that, she sent me this next text. I'm sending it to you again to page, board, message. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInteresting. Usually with invites like this, there's already an ad to calendar. And this one didn't have it though. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I just sent them both. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is a one off. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt's a one off. But if I have a link to go accept an invitation, will it pick it up? I went into that link and I filled out my name and my email address and said, yes, I will attend. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think that would be hard to do because it always has to be run through the same invite platform, which that is not always the case. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, that's a good point. However, if you confirmed in the message, I'll be add, set, event at this time on this date, then we would pick it up in that way. Trick the system. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTricking the system. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I can just answer back to her, yes, I'll be there. And then fill in my link. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNot necessarily though, because that's a picture that came through. It looks like this. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI sent it to her. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI see if it was. Yes. I'll be at the happy hour or whatever you call the event. I'll be at the networking event on Tuesday 19th, 04:00 p.m. Then we would capture that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd that's fair as long as we know that. And so if we act correctly, it's going to do what we need it to do. So that's a good. Yes, I will be there on February 6. Okay. So that makes sense. Okay. I love it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo I think we got a lot of good things rolling. I got like four more minutes. Is there any other hit points that you guys think we need to do? Know anything? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, we talked and we can do this async. We can do this off the call, but we talked about quite a few different processes that you were very interested in. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPrioritizing them and I'll send them back to you of everything we talked about prioritizing them as what would be the best time investment. The best return on investment would help us go back to our team and then analyze with the developers how much time would it take to integrate these. And then we come back to you with this is the time invested to ROI. And then we can figure out a phase two. These action plans and tasks to Google Calendar is what we call a phase one. And then phase two is these social media tools is new things we want to add on top of follow up as we're stepping into some more sophisticated stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, like the lead generation. We were kind of talking about the lead generation. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo we can talk about probably priority. No, I got you. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I want the leads and whenever it's possible so that we can start beta testing the text to follow up boss to Google Calendar. We can have access to one of your follow up boss accounts. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEasy. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe created our own. We created our own to test and mess it up as much as we. So then when it's ready and tested, we'll start integrating to your account. Just getting access now is going to get us a better view of what the current action plans look like, what the templates look like, all that stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI can text you my info to go in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnything else? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I think for us it's just we're going to get that integration, fine tune it, test it, and then we'll let you know when we're ready to start using your follow up boss account. And then we'll tune for the action plan list. And the details around that. So then we can start looking into the integrations between Mary Gold gifting and the Etsy accounts. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. Awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I will get that action plan, let's say this time next week by so it might before. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, cool. Well, we already. So we're ready to keep going. David, what would be the best way for us to stay in touch? And we can touch on follow up boss stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou can phone, email, anything. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. Then we can probably text. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I've gotten the email from the event. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGreat. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAwesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou have David's information and stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHe just put it in the. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAt another if we'd love to see what you're doing with social media, understand it and help in any way. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nStill, are you a fan of the KD lending team? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight now? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI'm following. I'm a follower. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nSo yeah, we are building it up so as we have more events and mean Devon, she shared the, what is it called? Help me. Yeah, I've been doing a couple of things there. So I have a few things that are. We just started. We just started on. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGreat. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGreat to hear. Well, thank you guys for your time. Thank you, Devin, for all the energy and creativity. Thank you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAbsolutely. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHe's my taskmaster. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, I think with all of the brains here, we can really put all of this to flow. I think we all have some homework to do and get this drawing board to life. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. Love it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAbsolutely. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd we are pushing internally to get movement moving. Yeah, moving. Exactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHoopman. Moving. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThank you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you, everyone. We'll talk soon. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, thank you. Bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-06 Discover Call Client - Real Estate Phase 1 and future integrationscleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nRefresh my python knowledge so I can work with that language, I guess. Last few months, I mainly do prompting, so I have to just refresh that python thing. I think I can handle that language. And, and in the same breath, I work with Bartech or some kind of automations. So I think it's good enough for me right now. The question was, how can you help me grow? I think it's no good answer for that because I want to just do the work you do. You understand that I have to just take a task and do it. So right now I do. It's enough. I want to just adapt. I don't have any special request for you. But if you do, I can write you if I know.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI might jump into this discussion because I'm sort of taking responsibility for Hubert's growth and I'm also guiding him in this journey. So currently he's focusing on Python. We're also doing this upwork automation. We have the Q one for that. So coming to the idea of making PFA swarm, I advise Cuba to dig into the python, dig into the language chain, dig into the outage system as an example to get familiar with the concepts. And later I think we're going to go on to making PFA swarm in code. That might be also a project we share with everybody. We'll do some that later.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's some fun multi-agent function calling kind of project. So, Bartek, how fluid are you with langchain?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm quite lazy, so I use GPT every time. Yeah, I'm not that fluent as I was in flutter like one year ago. Now I'm also not that fluent but was fluent. Like I could just think of something and code it up. Now I'm too much in the no codes, too much in prompting, too much actually because I'm not only developing stuff in syllabus, I'm also helping with everything with self-organization. We have a lot of conversations with Pablo about how we frame this business and stuff like that. So I'm stretched out everywhere. Don't have really time to focus on my coding skills. But I think with a little thought and with a little help of AI, I think I can do anything that.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nA project that is coming more and more vividly as an opportunity for all of us here to collaborate, plus Henry too. So pretty much all of us, pretty much all of the dev team, which is knowledge now. Knowledge now involves lang chain, involves system design, and if we think meta for a second, involves a lot of organization, involves clear tasks, clear objectives, defined success criteria, kind of what a product manager would help an engineering team with. Maybe it's in product manager, maybe traditionally engineering lead, technical lead, whatever you want to call it. But we need process, we need organization, we need clear criteria for what success means. Otherwise, we'll keep going in circles. Inevitably, it's normal. We want to do our best work well. Henry put the initiative at the beginning of faster Eyes, at the very beginning of like let's adopt a scrum framework. It makes sense, it's relatively simple to follow. So what might that look like for faster eyes? And especially as new developers come in because a client brings developers when the money is expected to flow, the developers will flock. Because we all want to do our best work, but we also want to get paid to do our best work. So, Hubi, we don't really have a process that we can onboard you into, and I don't think that's fair to you. I don't think that's fair to us either. I don't think that's fair to the standard that we need to set it fasterize. So over the next few days, share your thoughts. What is a framework that has worked for you in the past? Maybe it's in a job that you had, maybe you learned something in university.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAt syllabus training, I've been giving guys like Hubert and also Camille, another junior at syllabus, he's quite busy now with his job, so he's kind off for now because he got promoted in his job. So he's very busy.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWe start getting into more web development projects eventually, and there's one really good web developer and there's other web developers that are still junior. This one really good web developer would be everything would kind of fall on him. The guiding of the other three. And it will still happen in any process because there's somebody that can guide the others. However, there's a big difference between relying on the person that can guide in an organized manner. When objectives are clear when the task is very clear when the success criteria is clear, and when none of that is clear. Kuba, you've done amazing work on the personalized outreach system. You set up a multi-agent system, a multi-prompt, multi-tool system. So it might be v one, but you pulled that off pretty much yourself, and we helped. Bartech, thank you so much for all the help with the prompts. When we're talking the system itself, Kuba, you did incredible work. For example, waiting a whole day after Kuba is done with the upgrades to figure out what is the next step, as opposed to, well, we had a planning session, we know what this next week is going to be, and we know what we call success at the end of these two weeks. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I read something about using scrum Agile methodology, having a project backlog to check when you're working on projects.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWould you be able to maybe find that blog, maybe find something like it and share it with us and we can give it a read? Finally, I want to be very clear that this should not take away from the work that we're doing. On that note, planning session when can we get together and map out what knowledge now will be? Because Cuba is about to start working on the first prototype. The transcriptions are not perfect. We'll figure out how they can better. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat system?\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBecause I'm using whisper. But there has to be something better. There are no names. Right. So part of the planning session is this is figuring out these details, but actually very important details. Would tomorrow at 01:00 p.m. GMT work? We need to find a time that works for the four of us here.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI will be available from 01:30 p.m.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTomorrow.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm yet to confirm if the call with page will be in that time. Maybe.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n130 GMT 01:30 p.m. GMT plus one I will be back home because I'm going to the doctor with my daughter. But I still have to confirm with page because 06:00 a.m. Is kind of tough, especially for the recording.Speaker 4\\n06:00 a.m.. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTomorrow. Yeah, because we had this content call about 06:00 a.m.. Tomorrow. But I'm trying to put that later because 06:00 a.m. Will be hard to get up and hard to record a video. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo just so I understand, you said 130 p. M. GMT plus one is when you could be I'm back home. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm back home back to being available. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo at 02:00 p.m. GMT plus one, you would be fine with joining. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm trying to schedule that 02:00 p.m. Actually for page. So maybe if we can get. Wait. 03:00 p.m. I have actually recalled 04:00 p.m. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat is already kind of late. That would be my 02:00 a.m. I'm trying to keep sleep time before two. We can do this async. I thought it would be easy and straightforward, but no, we have so many different time zones and things going on. We'll plan this async, but let's meet up tomorrow and we can dig into the system, the real estate automation. There is a heavy load in. Sort of trying to teach what I've learned over the past week, the intricacies of the API, how it works, where it fails. I think I got banned from the system from sending too many requests at the same time. So now I have to go figure that out. There is quite a few intricacies. However, we talked about the areas where Ubartek could really help, which is the prompts. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo I'll be sharing some of the stuff that we need for that system. But it's pretty straightforward when it comes to the phase two of this client, where we actually start getting paid and the complexity of what we do starts increasing a little bit, the integrations and such, then we'll kind of reconvene on that project, and it's like planning session. Who needs to take on which task each phase of the project, et cetera. For now, on the real estate project front, it's looking fluid. It's flowing. We can put some time into knowledge now, which is just going to help all of us. It's going to help all of us. My vision is also knowledgenow, being our pair programmer, because it knows the objectives. Because we had a planning session, right? We have a planning session. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nKnowledgenow knows all the details of that planning session, and it knows how to code. So what better buddy for coding the tasks than the guy that is at every meeting paying attention to every single word, making the logic work and filling the gaps? It is not on yukuba to make that work on this first prototype. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI just want to make that very clear. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBut that is the vision, and that vision requires planning. So we'll get together tomorrow and plan that out. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'll be either joining or asking. If you make a call tomorrow, we'll see what Paige say about the content call. We'll try to fit in. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHey, I'll make it work. I don't care. It needs to be tomorrow. Whatever time it is, I'll make it work. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf I am available tomorrow since 06:00 a.m. To even 09:00 p.m. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo all the day. Perfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAwesome. That's great to hear. Thank you. Hubert. What's your availability looking like tomorrow? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI'm always available in the morning around 02:00 p.m.. GMT. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, cool. Till 02:00 p.m.. GMT. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI'm sure we can figure it out and make it work. Questions? You guys have anything you need clarity on? I'm happy to look at any of the projects. We're setting up that workshop for icebreakers. So I'm going to set up an airtable function in your code. Cuba for the personalized outreach system starts logging all the icebreakers into airtable. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSpeaking of outreach, maybe we talk about this upwork system. I just try to bring that up. Would I have it? And we might talk about setting up the upwork group from whoever wants to be in this initiative. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, that's a fantastic idea, man. Give me 1 second, I'll be right back. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. Batek? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHave you started developing the opoque arteries system. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOnce again? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHave you started developing it? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHave you started building it? The system ophook outreach system where I built that. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHave you started building it? Have you started developing it? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I have version one already working. It's on make, just show it in a second to open it. This old stuff. Share the screen? I cannot share the screen until Alayo lets me. We gotta wait. I'll be right back in 1 minute. All right, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, we're good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIn 1 minute. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. Can you let me share the screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou're good now? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, I cannot share the whole screen. Right. I have just so many tabs open you cannot imagine and I need to choose one now. All right, here it is. You see a data table now. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo in general, this thing goes into airtable and gives the title of the job, a description of the job, reason why it's relevant. Because there is also AI that assess the relevancy of this job in terms of my skills, or it can be agency skills or what the agency doing or whatever. And then this is the V one. I didn't even put much effort into this icebreaker thing, so it's kind of generic. But the plan is to make that also generate the proposal. I have a GPT for that works quite good in generating those proposals. I will have to connect that with the system and later it will already generate the proposals. And maybe later we find out how to automate sending of those proposals too. But on the other hand, I'm not sure about if we wanted that from the start. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFrom the start we want rather a human to check it out because upwork requires connects to apply for the job. So you need to actually pay a few dollars to apply for the job. So maybe it will better not to automate that fully, but the search is definitely perfect for automation. So what do we have here? Is Rs fit for automation related projects? We're parsing that, going to the GPT, parsing again and checking relevancy if it's relevant. So it's actually a finding the JSON here because the result needs to be true and the result is the reason from here. So it's say like you're having jobs true or false in json format and then it goes a bit of fusion prompting and then the result should be like this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo when the job is not relevant it goes result false and this is the actual output. I mean this is the problem. But this is how the output looks like. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLike that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo you go, the result is false. So in here it would just stop in here. Basically this is the right. Cool. How do I go back from here? Yeah, so result is true, then it goes to the router and if not, then it just stopped right there. So let's run it for a second or maybe I'll just go over the prompt here in full. What we have here more. Then we have the reason like this is about and an icebreaker. And those are negative example. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nEach of those is an example. Interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is futures prompting inside of meg.com because you have user assistant user basically simulating the conversation. And then we have results. True. And then there is icebreaker coming up. And this is actually one of the proposals I written by hand, not by hand, but with AI and then review by hand. So let's have that run. I should have that going all around, but saving some tokens. So let's have today and let's have say 3 hours before. So we'll have the freshest stuff going on and then it will just go. As you can see, we got two of them actually. Everyone was relevant, so one wasn't. Eight results, five relevant. It's all appearing over here. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd it just should. Right. AI generated comments for LinkedIn post. Interesting. LMA development. Good. Yeah. So that's how it goes. We got a chat bot and then we can have a link for now. It's quite clunky still because it's v one, obviously. Yeah, maybe I should just stop that. We got already tier t results and as you can see those tier t jobs and we have tier t jobs relevant. We didn't have to actually go and look at this and read it ourselves. That's one thing. Another thing. We just basically now going to go to your table and just look at those 13 jobs and then see if they're actually good to apply. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. That's pretty cool, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. And also in the template I was doing it from, there was the get budget regular expression, but it's not working correctly now. I will be working on fixing that. So later you could also have another router and you could have hourly jobs and fixed price jobs separately. But it's still working overhill, adding all the jobs into one place for now. Oh, we got a project with vector database custom GPT. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWould you look at that? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWould you look at that? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt was 60 minutes ago, man. This is the point of this automation is we get freshest stuff out of. Yeah, they basically want vectorbase connected to custom GPT. I'm not sure if there are GPTs. They mean this could be just an instance of chat GPT API langchain though the price is fixed. They usually put this hourly rate. This could be hourly rate. They sometimes do like this fixed price. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFor hourly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's definitely hourly rate. Some clients are lazy to click the other option and just write whatever. And to be honest, I'm not sure if I would apply to this. He's already interviewing people. Yeah, sometimes these things happen very fast. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTwelve minutes ago, deserve those. Feel like they're all bots. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's look at the other one. Here we have. That's more appropriate price. You ain't going to get much money from upwork. This is just like get a client, get a job, get some quick bucks and that's it. Not, that's it actually, because you can upsell. I think the biggest actually thing in working on upwork would be upselling. We have this decline now in us that's from chatbots for very little money and very simple stuff. But later, now we have project for possibly way more and possibly a few months of working with the client on a retainer basis. Cool. So I'm thinking of it as another funnel for getting bigger clients. Also, while still we can also try to make some bucks on these jobs, we can definitely filter out those $40 jobs, not this $180 jobs. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe could either decide that, okay, this could be client just type hourly job instead, or we could just filter out those type of jobs at all. Like just filter them out. Not even look at those. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's yet to be decided. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou will be dealing with the famous Ferris NASA. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm trying to find some better job. This is hourly ongoing. Yeah, I think we should make. If there are people who want to do that in fasterized because you can also make agency profile on upwork. Oh no, I think we should make fasterized agency. We will be also making celebrities agency. And also I think everybody who want to be involved should also have their own profile, also looking on their own. And we need to make as big net like phishing as possible because there is not only proposals, also people inviting you for the jobs. So the more profiles we have, the better chance of getting more leads. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, no, this is a really good point. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, let's park it for now and maybe on the next gen exec ask people who want to join the initiative. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo if we look at those draft proposals, we adjust them. We give it as examples for many shot prompting one end and then on the other end. Each of us have our profile. I already have my profile, Pedro already has her profile, Henry already has his profile. We get profile set up for everybody else. We sort of coalesce into an agency. What else are we really doing? Since now the proposals will be much better because we actually reviewed and gave a bunch of good examples. We all have our profiles, we all give each other recommendation letters. What else would be needed on like an active day by day or week by week basis? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe should have some work history, kind of, let's say all the projects, because my work history on upwork is just all the syllabus projects currently, all the projects we've been doing for past half a year, even if some of them wasn't really delivered fully, if there was something that I make, it was working, I just put it there. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, so maybe we do a workshop together and we just do it in one go. And in that workshop we help each other set up the profiles. Whoever needs to set it up from the beginning. I, for example, need to put in projects, well, the description of the project, and we can help each other make the best descriptions that we can make sure that we all give each other recommendations as opposed to like Async, go create your upwork profile, because it's pretty tedious. The ROI seems to be there, but it's pretty tedious. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. I think everybody come prepared with their story because there is, how to say, like a framework to achieve the sales goal, to get the client to offer you the job while keeping us close to the truth, but showing you in the best light. So for example, I have a little stretch out on my experience because I've been programming for three years, almost four years, but in my profile there is like, I'm freelancing for three years already, but I'm freelancing for like one year and a half. And everybody should come prepared with the story. I mean, I actually have some little, but I have some experience to show off. For example, I was talking with Hubert. He doesn't have those past things he done before syllabus or maybe before. He was also in a group of my learning groups in the past. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut the reason, what I'm talking about this is, I say, hubert, you need to have your story, like bring your story of how you come to this place where you are developer now and make that believable for your clients. When they will be reading that, they need to believe that, okay, this guy done this and this. So now he's capable of doing my job. So I think, yes, we should maybe do that together, the profiles. But first, everybody should think about this story. Have given really a good thought to make the story believable and make the story defensible. Like if somebody asks about something from that story, the person should, without second of hesitation, just respond, yeah, I did this and this and yeah, because I can do that for my story. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNow everybody else need to craft their story so they can also do the same. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThen Bartek, let's simplify so we can move forward. So let's ask, we'll plan the workshop soon. So we already have two workshops that we need to do next week and then by the week after. So two weeks from now, people come with bullet points of their story and be it a GPT that puts the story together and then we edit it. Or maybe you brought a few paragraphs and we challenge each other to how we can make it better. Let's make sure that I think everybody. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShould start from thinking how you can feel your LinkedIn profile, how you can feel your work experience to make yourself believable, to be the. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nKind of like. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBy, I think GPT can handle that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSorry to interrupt you, but I think it's GPT agent can handle with make LinkedIn profile. Can or cannot can help. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAt least advise you. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, for sure. There is the natural sound of human writing, which GPT, unless you're prompting it really well, won't quite capture, however, a great first draft that then you put your tone on it because you already know your experience. Hey, I worked here. I worked on this project and work on that project for this workshop in two weeks. Let's have people show up with at very least some bullet points, if not having already worked on their LinkedIn profiles, which is also going to be critical for all of us. Regardless of anything, having good LinkedIn profile is important and then we can transfer those elements to upwork. LinkedIn is a platform that people are very familiar with, so the lift from actually updating your LinkedIn is a lot lower than go figure out this new platform and then we just transfer it over. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo let's do that. It's like, hey, bring your story and go into your LinkedIn and update whatever you want to update. Yeah, cool. So let me write that downwork workshop in two weeks. Link, update at least one thing in your link. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWe'll take it like that. Bring your story even in bullet points and update at least one thing in your LinkedIn. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSeems cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLet's see. Thinking. Awesome. Thank you for that effort, man. It looks like a really cool system. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we'll continue working on that. I think we would have multiple versions running, for example, for agency and for particular people because I think we also should map, I don't know about how it's going with the competency matrix, but I think we should definitely, at least developers that want to do the upwork thing, we should map out all the skills we have and kind of make the profiles of each one of us, specialize in something, and then all of the group cover all of the stuff that we want to do. But the profile should be specialized. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThese are all things that feel like great ideas for workshops that we do together, synchronize. So we're on the same page. We all understand the same criteria of level of experience. For example, competency matrix, maybe even in breakout rooms. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think more of like going deeper, like the particular tools. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause people making the job or searching for a freelancer might be looking for a specific tool. And if you get a freelancer that say, I specialize in this tool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen you're going to take this one. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo we have the air table. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHave the competency matrix to then say like, oh, this person, like this person should apply for the job. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Oh, that's cool, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. I love how this is coming together. A lot of work to be done, but we have the right tools, we have the right people. Bartek, if your client says, hey, let's start tomorrow, update us. Your time availability is very important that we know so we know when to rely on you because we want to rely on you because you're somebody that is reliable and you have many skills and many ideas and a lot of vision that all of us are going to benefit from. And hopefully it goes the other way too. So if availability changes at all, please let us know. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd we'll get together tomorrow and plan knowledge now. And yeah, there's definitely work to be done. Hooby, I would say within the next 24 hours before we meet, get some lang chain brushed up on and get ready for a small prototype. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I'm still training with that. I think I can handle it in few days. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, a few days sounds great. When I say small product. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI can try since tomorrow, but I. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCan promise that tomorrow is a planning session. Yeah, exactly. So tomorrow's planning session. You're going to have time. We're not going to put you in a time pressure. We'll also put a deadline, a reasonable deadline. So there's something that you're working towards. But just know we want to make this work for you. Tomorrow, it's knowledge now, next week, it might be another project, or it might be the next version of what you worked on. Whatever helps build these two skills that you mentioned. I want to work on Python and Langchain, and we have some cool projects to help you build those skills. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSeems fine for me. Really good. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThanks. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor today, I think I advise you to go over the project of outage system. And as I mentioned, I don't know if you started that, but as I mentioned before, you can just copy the cells, just don't copy the API. The API key to the chat, and have to explain every line of the code, what it does here, what it does there. And if you go over this whole automation we have for the outreach system, I think you'll get things tomorrow. All right. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I think that's a great idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSort. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nGetting an understanding of the step by step of the outreach system. Great suggestion, Bartek. I'm going to drop in the discord and tag you with Hoobi. There's a GitHub, and there's also a Google Colab. I tagged you on the Google Colab. A lot more digestible. It's piece by piece, cell by cell. The GitHub is 600 lines of code, so it can be a lot to even look at. It definitely was for me. The Google Colab is two lines of code. Three lines of code, two lines of code. So it's a lot easier to follow. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I will check. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIf you need any clarity, we're here. Text us. Text the group chat. And let's keep moving forward. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt. Sure. Think. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCheers, y'all. See you soon. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSee you soon. Bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-07 Dev Meeting - Planning Scrum, organizingcleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nToday's question is, what is your favorite childhood game?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor me, it's a game we played in middle school and high school called cuadros. It's like squares, and we would play with a ball, hitting it in your square and then into the next one.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt depends on the age, right? It changes over from more physical and playing on the field to computer games.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI have played basketball in a few tournaments and was quite good in it, even won an MVP trophy and one victory.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe do like to start these meetings with a connection because the most important thing here are you, all the human. Our overarching vision and mission is to amplify the human, to find the parts where being human really matters, and then figure out how to automate and efficientize all the other boring, tedious things so that we can amplify our human aspects. We have some new members to welcome: Kuba, Zach, who's driving right now, but he's with us, and Hubert.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI have a proposition when we come to that topic. We should get more people for content creation and editors. We're doing great stuff in here, but nobody knows.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI agree. I have a friend who lives in Indonesia and Bali who does incredible video editing work. Alejo and I are going to set up a meeting with him in the next week to talk about bringing him on board.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWe could reach out to some people in social media that would maybe like to join us and help with the content.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAs part of our new member onboarding process, we have a one month onboarding trial period. After that point, we get together here in these meetings and we vote. Today, Zach is up for a vote to officially join.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe want to keep the vote as simple but expressive as possible. It will either be yes, or here's my concern about this person.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUpdates from our end about our first client that we've recently closed. Alejo and I had a meeting with our client, her name is Devin, and another mortgage lender who is her mom. They use the CRM platform Follow up Boss to manage all of their clients. The first automation that we're setting up is a presentation to give a little visual of what we're doing. Devin's goal in 2024 is to get systems running efficiently, so that on the client touch point side, she doesn't have to do anything. Part of how she facilitates relationships with realtors is by sending out gift baskets quarterly to all the realtors in her network. One of the future automations that we'll be setting up will be automating that whole process.Speaker 2\\nAnd if you do have a canvas subscription, let's save you some money. Jump on this one. Even if it's for personal stuff, we want to save as much money from people as possible. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, so we have a little roadmap overview. Executive summary this is the phase one objectives is touch free appointment setting between text messages, follow up boss and Google Calendar and then optimize the action plans which are the internal automations that you can set up within the CRM and to automate the action plan set up for new leads which would look like you go to an open house, people sign in and then you can take a picture of that sign in sheet and it automatically transfers into the CRM follow up boss little visual. What the automation will look like is a text message comes in and there's some kinds of confirmation that yes, this task will get done or this event will get done which triggers a task in follow up boss and then will create an event in the Google calendar. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo some of the use cases that we showed look like this. So Jane sends a message, hey, can we hop on a call at 03:00 p.m.? Tomorrow? Yes, you then that's the confirmation activates the trigger to create the task. And in this use case it's going to capture the name of the contact, the date, the time, what the task is, and then the phone number, and then it will send that over to Google Calendar. Second use case would be, hey, you want to meet at Ingrano, which is a bakery, later at two. So we're going to meet in person at this place at two. Yes to you. Then that's the confirmation. We have a trigger to create the task. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIn this case, it's going to capture the name, the date, the time and the location, and then that will get transferred over to Google calendar. Some other use cases that they get a lot are about pre approval letters and parts of the mortgage process, which so far in what we phased out for this client, we haven't even touched the nitty gritty of the mortgage lending process. What we're starting with is all about client management and client relationships. So there's definitely a lot of room to grow. Joe Locke needs the pre approval confirmation. Okay, I'll send the pre approval letter tomorrow. That activates the trigger to set the task. This time it's going to capture the name of the client. So this person, Joe Locke, the date we've organized to preset the time tonight, 09:00 a.m. For tasks. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo they just show up in her follow up bosses, her task list, and then it also creates the task in Google Calendar. Can you call Amy today to discuss pre approval? Sure. I'll give her a call this afternoon. So it's going to activate the trigger for the task and follow up boss, capture the name, the date, the time and the task, and that will then go over to Google Calendar. And then these are situations where a trigger wouldn't be activated because we don't want the client to end up with a slew of random events in their Google calendar. So in this case, someone might send a text that says, got the pre approval letter for Carl. Thanks. Woohoo. You got it. There's no action to trigger. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd the logic is that this message is a confirmation of a receipt, not a task to be created or not an event. So we're capturing tasks and events. Second example. So happy Jen settled. Great work. Thank you. There's no action to trigger, so it doesn't go because the message is a congratulatory statement. And then the second part of the action plans optimization is going to be, I don't have the next part of this will have a visual. But Devin's follow up boss person is responsible for manually inputting her 1300 plus clients into her database right now. And he's setting up the internal action plans, which are no code it's all already built into follow up boss. Where we come in is once we get the action plans that they've set up, every person will have an action plan and every person will be tagged. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo a realtor will have a Realtor tag. A first time home buyer will have a first time home buyer tag, and there will be several categories. So it hits third quarter. There's an automation that externally, an automation triggers to then externally send all of the realtors in the database to send their contact information over to another business that they're already working with, that then puts the gift baskets together and sends them out so she doesn't have to do anything. And that happens every quarter. Another example is we get a closing date. So let's say the closing date is March 31. Once that closing date gets set in the calendar, there's a trigger in the action plan that says okay, that means by March 6 a letter and this needs to get sent out for this client's close date. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we need to create this task in our Google calendar with the close date. And then from there we're looking at working with her social media person to optimize their social media and marketing process. So we'll be looking at different tools to help automate reels. We've been using Opus pro lately. There's a bunch out there, but to really make her job easier and increase the quality of the content that she's generating, we're waiting on confirmation from they work for movement mortgage. So movement mortgage currently does not use follow up boss as their CRM, but they're pending approval to integrate. Once we get the integration, then we'll be looking at a lot of email and follow up boss integrations as well as the external integrations and then we go from there. So stay tuned. Moving along. There we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that's where we're at with our client update. I know the dev team is working hard to set up the text to Google Calendar automation and we'll keep you posted on that. Questions? Comments? Thoughts? Cool. We've also got some other projects that we're working on. So let's see. I know York, are you with us? York has been working on setting up an automated outreach system. Can you share an update on what you've been doing with that? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHey guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nEveryone. So first of all, I think we set up a nimal campaign like a week ago. The results aren't the best, but our goal here was to first learn from us and have experience. Then of course on the next campaign that should be on next Tuesday we are going to have this data to improve our emails and I've been getting on the calls with Zach and we are trying our best to make this work. So overall we are trying to. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLeverage. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nEmail campaigns to get clients. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAwesome. Thanks for the update, Jorg. I know you and Zach are going to make some magic happen and already from the few calls that we've had, we've been meeting about outreach during some of our cold calling. Zach has had some really incredible feedback and feed forward as our sort of go to salesperson in the room. So please use him as a resource. He has a lot of valuable insights to share and I'm super excited to see how this campaign goes. On the outreach note, I know Kuba has also been working with the dev team on an automated outreach system. Kuba, will you share a little bit about what you're doing? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHi guys. So we are building like a personalized outreach system where we script LinkedIn information about a prospect and use that to create a personalized email based on information about the person. So we're still building and still in progress. We have v one ready just iterating with the phone to make it better. So to get better quality email. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd on that note, two upcoming workshops are going to be. The first one is getting together your exact everybody that wants to join, everybody that has an idea to how we could do outreach, write emails and craft an offer, essentially regard vitp together and craft some emails, some variations of emails that we can go and test. So together, kind of individually, together, we put our best effort, our best idea to, hey, I think that this is the best way to phrase who we are. We talk about amplifying the human. How do we put it in actual text in an email? So Jorg, you've been mentioning coming across as a person, as a human, which is what we are. And we also want to get to the point where we can outreach to as many people in the world as possible. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd through this, what will become incredible examples for a different automated system where we can scale, where faster I can scale. We're doing a second workshop where we're figuring out first, what are some hooks or icebreakers that could be optimal. So the system, the V one, is going to put out some hooks based on this person's profile. These are two possible hooks for the beginning of the email. Great. Well, what's good about them, what's bad about them? We simplify. What's good about one thing that's good about them, one thing that's bad about each example. And again, great training data for us to scale up. So thank you for all of your efforts. All of you individually specifically, that have been doing any kind of outreach, that have been helping, have been throwing ideas. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's all coming together into these different layers and we'll keep going and we'll set up these workshops in the coming week to put our brains together. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThanks, Alejo. And you've also been working on building a knowledge based system. So what's the update? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat is the see, let's see. It is actually running right now. It's been running the last about 30 minutes, creating transcripts of all of our calls since a month ago, since the beginning of February. And it's creating these transcripts. It's also creating transcripts without the timestamps. Different ways that we can use this data, create summaries. What will be the most effective way to have this data? Let me rephrase that. What will be the most effective way to create a knowledge base off of this data? We've thought about summaries. We've thought about, just give it the full transcript. We've thought about give it both. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd Kuba is taking on the making, it's taking on the actual doing, and I'm trying to set him up for success as much as possible, but he is the one that knows these chains of agents Lang chain very well and not going to put any expectations. I just want you to do your best work and I'm glad that you showed interest in this. So we're moving forward with the knowledge based system. The first thing that we needed to do is have all the transcripts of the call. We'll figure out what step we know what step two is now. Create a summary, create bullet points, create what is the action plan from this call? When we're talking about the Google calendar automation, there's a step by step that we talked about in the call. Can we get this system to retrieve that step by step? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat is our first goal. Can we get this system to retrieve the step by step that we talk in the development call? And step zero is actually fixing this because now it keeps getting confused with faster rice and all different types of variations, like faster rice, like cooking rice faster, or faster ICE, like watching something faster. We'll get around to it, no worries. But that's part of what we have to show. Example is like, it's not this word, it's that word. Anyway. So we're moving forward. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe're moving forward. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd the knowledge base, as they've said before, which we're calling knowledge now. It's sort of the V one name for it. Knowledge now is not only something that's going to help us like multiply productivity, not ever have to ask again, hey, what were the tasks that I had to do that we talked about in that call and become a partner of each of us within faster. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNot only is it going to become that, but for each of our customers, when they're ready to upgrade, when they're ready to level up their systems. Because this text message to google calendar, that's great. It's going to save devin and kim so much time. But that's not where he stops. What is the level up? And what is the level up to? The level up. How can we get to integrate knowledge now with their systems so they can upgrade their systems? Very exciting stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I'm excited for that. There's a lot of capabilities and ways that this can be super valuable to companies. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd. Sorry, bartech, we've yet to get together and also keep talking technicals over this, what is potentially a rack system. So let's get together, you, kuba and me, and we can throw ideas, discuss, challenge each other, and come up with the best thing for this next version. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, my brain actually stopped three minutes ago and I'm still thinking about the knowledge base structure that would best for this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLove it. And if we had the knowledge now, right now, you could be like, hey, what did we say in those three minutes that I missed while I was thinking? And it would know the answer. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. Also, I dropped some comments into your notion when you showed me the notion. You saw those comments. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI did. I actually went over them today. Thank you so much. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, very good suggestions. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCivil was a great example to kind of look up to. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. And we also have, I mean, in this example you showed now, I think the first thing I noticed lacking was who was speaking this line. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo it might not be whisper, it might be integrated directly to zoom. We'll figure that out. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. And to extract information. I think categorizing definitely, like having this is that call. This is about this and this. We want this and that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, that is definitely the path that we're going. These sort of gates of information and metadata of what is relevant. Yes, no. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd speaking of, Bartech, who is very much in the eat while I'm working, work, sleep, repeat mode, has been building an amazing product called PFA, aka prompt factory assistant, and he just shared the newest version in the Discord channel. Bartek. I'm going to pass it to you. So you can just give a summary of what it is and the latest updates you've made to it. So everyone's on board because we got to get in there and play with it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYep, definitely. I make some changes to the user experience mostly that's what the focus of this version was, to get the TFA latent space, which I was trying to tie together for past month, and I just get worse outputs every time I change something. So I first think last week I decided to change just 5% of the prompt, but this is not enough. The outputs was still worse. So then I think, okay, maybe 1%. Yeah, but then I couldn't find that 1% where I should put the change, and it actually came up to around 3% of the change. And I think that this is the good version we're using for lead magnets. So using by business people who don't really know how to prompt. So this version is to guide them through the process, like handholding. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNow I'm doing this, now I'm doing that, and that's basically explaining the process. Yeah, I saw the outputs are quite good. There could be some little downsides sometimes in compared to the previous version because the UAX is making cluster, obviously, but we need that for this version. So I'm happy to get some feedback from this if the outputs are good for you guys, and more feedback on the UX. If this UX is good, think from the user experience of the business person who doesn't know prompting, doesn't know much about AI. Does the target for this version love it? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Thank you for sharing. If you go to the prompt Factory channel under Project Bartech posted it recently and once you get in and use it, please share your feedback with Bartech. With the team, we're building up our own testimonials and use cases so that we can put it out in the world and share the amazingness of PFA. I've built a couple GPTs using PFA and it's made the whole prompting process so much faster and very high quality. So if you haven't gotten a chance, check it out and let us know how it's working for you and what you're using it for, because that data is extremely helpful for continuing to iterate even though it's already outstanding. The perfectionist tendencies kick in and we just keep making it better and better. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, but may I post a message to our transcript analyzer to have a timestamp of this exact minute so later we can rewind two minutes and then we have one video for the YouTube. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, we just. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWill that timestamp be saved automatically or it's better if we actually. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, so knowledge now save this timestamp. It's a transcript, it's a word, it's a keyword. Knowledge now save. Moving on. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAdded new function to the GPT. Now in the top left corner you can post feedback to the creator. So now you have two options. Either you send me the chat like before we had to make, or now you can actually use the new function and write some message to my email directly. But still, it's best to share something on top, like the screenshots or maybe video or whatever, but nothing too much. If that's what you don't have time for, then text will be just enough and we'll try to bleak something out of that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPerfect. Yeah, that's good to know. Yeah, that's what's keeping us busy these days. So we'll be posting updates for the next development stand ups as well as working session and we're going to be getting reach alignment team meeting in here soon, so stay tuned for those updates. What we will also be starting next week as a soft launch is called podcast Hour, the beginning of the fasterized podcast where we're going to hop on Zoom for an hour and pick a topic. Maybe it's a project that you're working on or something you're really psyched about and just generate some conversation from there. That gives us a lot of marketing material. To number one, put out shorts, reels, whatever it might be, and then also take longer clips to start building out our podcast. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAlso a great opportunity to practice public speaking and voicing what it is you're doing and putting it into words because it's definitely helpful to have that practice when you're in a situation at a networking event and you have to give an elevator pitch about what you're doing, which learning the hard way. So speaking of networking events, an update that Alejo and I are excited to share is that we had the opportunity to attend a session on generative AI real world use cases. I have some pictures to share because there's a lot of really great stuff here. We found this event on Meetup and let me share my screen. It was kind of nice to remember what a real office might look like. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo this was posted by domain, which I would compare to the american version of Zillow, a huge platform for house listings in Australia, and they're currently beta testing a version of it where it looks like chat GPT you write into it like you would write into chat. GPT. Hey, this is what I'm looking for. And it uses the robust knowledge base that they already have to give really instant and accurate results for what people are looking for. So that was a picture of the office and there were three speakers. No, I didn't mean to stop sharing. Okay. I wanted to share this because it made me laugh. And also, I think, is a good reminder. Can everyone see this picture? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo this guy, his name was Vince, and this little chat bubble is supposed to represent the chat bot, which he put into perspective and was a really big paradigm shift. At least when I entered the AI agency space, it seemed like chat bot solutions. That was it. We got to create the chat bot. And the way he looks at it, that's 1% with this 99% of potential and opportunity that isn't chat bots, that isn't sexy and might be more boring, but fits into this high value boring category, which I found is a really useful framework as we're thinking about innovative solutions to meet clients needs and really streamline their systems, supercharge their systems to amplify the human. This was also something he shared, which was from, okay, so this is from Jason Alejo, you can jump in and talk about that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nJason is the lead of product and design. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, he's the product and design lead for relevance. Relevance AI. And we found this event the day we arrived to Australia. And we're looking at the speakers and I'm like, wait, Jason from relevance AI? That's crazy. Turns out that he built their business development representative, and if you haven't played with it is freaking awesome. The personalized outreach system is very akin to what they built. We want low level control over what happens in that system. But essentially what we're going to test this personalized outreach system against is Ben the business development? Yeah, he is a very enlightening conversation. And this business development representative, salesperson, agent came from a passion project of his, and after hitting thousands and thousands of people on his YouTube channel, he started getting a lot of requests for sponsorships. We can sponsor you consultations, all kinds of requests. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd he couldn't keep up in his email, so he created essentially a chajibt integration to create drafts to answer those emails. So gave a bunch of examples of how he's answered those emails in the past, the stuff we already know. So good examples, good training data, now repeat for these new emails. And then he leveled that up into an agent that can do a bunch of different things, one super agent. But then he realized where it's really at is one agent that can number one, delegate to the right other agents, and that each agent has its own very specific task that it's good at. So many agents working together ended up being what made this really cool, very useful and very natural sales agent that is now live on relevance. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo we'll get around to testing it too and to get a feel for how good it is and how we want to do it on our end. Or we might find we don't need the personalized outreach system. Let's use this. I believe that low level control, at least mid level control over this kind of system and being able to adapt it to customers that might want the same system is a lot more valuable than just like this works. So let's just use it so things here in the long term. Anyway, the point is you can make a 5000 character prompt or you can make ten agents with 500 characters that are extremely good and extremely clear on what they have to do. Meaning Bartek, let's make that swarm, man. Let's make it happen. Whatever is needed from here, let's make it happen. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I'm thinking about it. To write PFA in wasn't because the PFA swarm is kind of built now, but still user have to mention another GPT from the. Yeah, so it's better to make actual swarm and I think I'm going there. I just want to make a little proof of concept in the GPT. So I'm already having prompts all set up and then we can just put that into the agenda system. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat's one thing I have now. Two things. First, relevance AI. Do we have like company account over there? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nActually just about the subscription. So yes we do. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, so let's connect about that later because I have some idea actually for also content automation, but let's park it for later. Can you go back two pictures in the app to this previous slide you were showing? Do you have this presentation? Maybe. I think this is great for content. This is great to put it on LinkedIn and just write some message about it. And that's great image. It's simple, but it's fucking awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I'll drop the whole thing in the discord. He kindly emailed it out to everyone if we filled out his little survey. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, we can a, make a post about it, B, make a video about it. You remember page when he told me that you sometimes put some educational shit on the background and we can put that on the background just like this guy here. You can just show. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, 100%. Yeah, I think it's great. And as someone who at least started off with a lot of fear around AI and care very deeply about the human element and ethics, ensuring that we have ethics in mind, the speaker, I think, provided a lot of paradigm shifts that gave me hope or maybe transform some of my fears that I have to wrestle with alongside of my hype around the possibilities with AI. And it was really cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd actually coming from here, we have one case study from our very first client at Sylabris that we are actually where to make a chatbot for him. But then after doing business analysis, we find another idea and totally reframed the whole development. And the chatbot was actually like a five priority or something like that. And first we had some internal integrations and automations. And that's a great story to accompany with this previous slide. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, total validation. And he had a lot of really insightful framings. He was talking about scale here and how we might be starting now with enhancing an existing feature with AI. And as we scale moving into creating a new feature that is no longer possible without AI there, that then scales higher up into a service offering that's no longer possible without AI, thus unlocking a whole new level of relevance in the market. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou saw this couple of slides that I have shared yesterday with some, we'll call it the methodology that we use and show on sales decks with celebrities. And it's perfectly aligned. I love this line. So it just makes us more assured that there is a slide that we call that you can either go with, optimize, accelerate, or transform. We use these three phrases. So those are basically the same concept that you might either try to just speed up your business, that it works like. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry, Powell, you're breaking up too much. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCreate some more value, like adding. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, Paolo, you can't hear propositions and boosting. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSome value propositions for existing products, for existing services, or create an entirely new business find product. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, hello. Yeah. Oh, there's the lag. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThere's the lag. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nJust wanted to refer to the slide that I shared yesterday and we might integrate that with what Jason just. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, yeah, so that was actually Vincent that shared that. Another great speaker. And Jason did this presentation and actually recorded all of it. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSo. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou guys can go watch it. This is how he started doing the system. He shows this whole process of how relevance now has its own business development agents that did all of this. Those are all sales meetings. Meetings. Parting purely from that agent. So very exciting stuff. And hopefully ours will look the same. And he has a YouTube channel. He did a Q and A. I will upload this and it'll be accessible to all of you. It's only 30 minutes and it's just pure value the whole time. It's great. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCan you hear me a little bit better now maybe. Oh, that's great. I just wanted to say, guys, sorry for my shitty connection. Yeah, I got some glitch so I don't want to comment too much at this moment. Just wanted to mention yesterday's slides that I shared to you a page and let's reconnect about it maybe because I see a lot of similarities between. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIs the methodology that we've been developing internally within celebrities and wanted to share it with fastrays as well. With the slide that you have just showed us. Sorry for my shitty connection. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll good? Yeah, we'll definitely set up a meeting to connect more about that. Great. And I just realized the Vince has his own GPT. Of course he does. My custom GPT agent trained on my boring versus sexy framework to help you develop initial use cases quickly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nGPT for use cases? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, based on framework. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI've done that like two months ago, something like that. Why? I didn't share it with anybody. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I know. Why didn't you? GPT based on that framework of. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBased on the boring versus sexy. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBoring. Sexy. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBased on any framework. I just make like a GPT that if you write your role in the company, like I don't know, invoice manager or whatever, it gives you like five ideas for automation or how you can use AI to amplify your job. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI love that. Man. There's so much we have to connect with and knowledge now we really have to pledge out the whole thing. We're 1 hour now and want to give a challenge to every single person. Fast rise, including the people that are not here now, they will get this challenge too, which is in the next week. Find an event, meetup, eventbrite, they're out there in the next week. Go to an event. Maybe it's related to AI, maybe it's related to programming, maybe some other interest that you have. There is unspeakable value to being in those events. How do you unlock that value will be very much up to you. Maybe it's an insight that a presenter does shares. Maybe it's the person that you networked with that was sitting next to you. And if you're like me, the ten people you network with. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause I can't stop saying hi to people mean just one insight, one network, unspeakable value. That's your challenge. That's our challenge. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe've got another one lined up tomorrow, so we'll come back with updates next week. And there is no dev working session tomorrow. Or is there a dev stand up tomorrow? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThere is a dev session. Dev stand up right now. We did kind of give the updates, but let's get together. We'll keep it short. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, well, thank you for joining us. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe can stay on here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I'm going to wait. Oops, I just stopped and started the summary. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-07 GenExec Meeting - Client Updates, Dev products, Outreach progress part1cleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nRefresh my python knowledge so I can work with that language, I guess. Last few months I mainly do prompting, so I have to just refresh that python thing. I think I can handle that language. And, and in the same breath I work with Bartech or some kind of automations. So I think it's good enough for me right now. The question was, how can you help me grow? I think it's no good answer for that because I want to just do the work you do. You understand that I have to just take a task and do it. So right now I do. It's enough. I want to just adapt.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAlso, I might jump into this discussion because I'm sort of taking responsibility for Hubert's growth and I'm also guiding him in this journey. So currently he's focusing on Python. We're also doing this upwork automation. We have the Q one for that. So coming to the idea of making PFA swarm, I advise Cuba to dig into the python, dig into the language chain, dig into the outage system as an example to get familiar with the concepts. And later I think we're going to go on to making PFA swarm in code. That might be also a project we share with everybody. We'll do some that later.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's some fun multi agent function calling kind of project. So, Bartek, how fluid are you with langchain?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm quite lazy, so I use GPT every time. I'm not that fluent as I was in flutter like one year ago. Now I'm too much in the no codes, too much in prompting, too much actually, because I'm not only developing stuff in syllabus, I'm also helping with everything with self organization. We have a lot of conversations with Pablo about how we frame this business and stuff like that. So I'm stretched out everywhere. Don't have really time to focus on my coding skills. But I think with a little thought and with a little help of AI, I can do anything that.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nA project that is coming more and more vividly as an opportunity for all of us here to collaborate, plus Henry too. So pretty much all of us, pretty much all of the dev team, which is knowledge now. Knowledge now involves lank chain, involves system design, and if we think meta for a second, involves a lot of organization, involves clear tasks, clear objectives, defined success criteria, kind of what a product manager would help an engineering team with. Maybe it's in product manager, maybe traditionally engineering lead, technical lead, whatever you want to call it. But we need process, we need organization, we need clear criteria for what success means. Otherwise we'll keep going in circles. What is best enough is one of the questions that we need to answer as we're starting a project, kind of in the brainstorming phase, and then we'll refine.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAs for example Hubi entering Hubi, we don't really have a process that we can onboard you into and I don't think that's fair to you. I don't think that's fair to us either. So over the next few days, share your thoughts. What is a framework that has worked for you in the past?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think we at syllabus training, I've been giving guys like Hubert and also Camille, another junior at syllabus, he's quite busy now with his job, so he's kind off for now because he got promoted in his job. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou're doing your job well, as a mentor. I'm going to say this, I do really like the concept that you threw out there of, hey, there's a problem and there's someone you can rely on. I think that's very important to know that I can have my autonomy and that if I. Sure, I'll try debugging myself, of course, but that if I hit a wall, I can rely on someone.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe guiding of the other three. And it will still happen in any process because there's somebody that can guide the others. It will happen, it should happen. It's great, it's productive. However, there's a big difference between relying on the person that can guide in an organized manner. When objectives are clear, when the task is very clear, when the success criteria is clear, and when none of that is clear, the level of chaos, that disorganization versus organization versus a process, a system that we can rely on as developers will define actually how productive we are as a team. For example, waiting a whole day after Kuba is done with the upgrades to figure out what is the next step, as opposed to, well, we had a planning session, we know what this next week is going to be, and we know what we call success at the end of these two weeks.\\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I read something about using scrum Aju methodology, having project backlog to check when you're working on projects. Detective, when developing, I've not tested it out on any project like when developing project.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo thank you. Would you be able to maybe find that blog, maybe find something like it and share it with us and we can give it a read?\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFinally, I want to be very clear that this should not take away from the work that we're doing, which we're programmers, we're programming. This should not be like, over the next four weeks, we spend 8 hours debating which is the best system. That is not what we're going to do. We're going to do is, hey, throw some ideas. What resonates. Let's try it and we go from there.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOn that note, planning session when can we get together and map out what knowledge now will be? Because Cuba is about to start working on the first prototype. I showed the transcriptions, right. The transcriptions are not perfect. We'll figure out how they can better. What system? Because I'm using whisper. But there has to be something better. There are no names. Right. So part of the planning session is this is figuring out these details, but actually very important details. Would tomorrow at 01:00 p.m. GMT work? We need to find a time that works for the four of us here.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI will be available from 01:30 p.m..\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTomorrow.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm yet to confirm if the call with page will be in that time. Maybe 130 GMT 01:30 p.m. GMT plus one I will be back home because I'm going to the doctor with my daughter. But I still have to confirm with page because 06:00 a.m. Is kind of tough, especially for the recording.Speaker 4\\n06:00 a.m.. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTomorrow. Yeah, because we had this content call about 06:00 a.m.. Tomorrow. But I'm trying to put that later because 06:00 a.m. Will be hard to get up and hard to record a video. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo just so I understand, you said 130 p. M. GMT plus one is when you could be I'm back home. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm back home back to being available. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo at 02:00 p.m. GMT plus one, you would be fine with joining. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm trying to schedule that 02:00 p.m. Actually for page. So maybe if we can get. Wait. 03:00 p.m. I have actually recalled 04:00 p.m. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat is already kind of late. That would be my 02:00 a.m. I'm trying to keep sleep time before two. We can do this async. I thought it would be easy and straightforward, but no, we have so many different time zones and things going on. We'll plan this async, but let's meet up tomorrow and we can dig into the system, the real estate automation. There is a heavy load in. Sort of trying to teach what I've learned over the past week, the intricacies of the API, how it works, where it fails. I think I got banned from the system from sending too many requests at the same time. So now I have to go figure that out. There is quite a few intricacies. However, we talked about the areas where Ubartek could really help, which is the prompts. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo I'll be sharing some of the stuff that we need for that system. But it's pretty straightforward when it comes to the phase two of this client, where we actually start getting paid and the complexity of what we do starts increasing a little bit, the integrations and such, then we'll kind of reconvene on that project, and it's like planning session. Who needs to take on which task each phase of the project, et cetera. For now, on the real estate project front, it's looking fluid. It's flowing. We can put some time into knowledge now, which is just going to help all of us. It's going to help all of us. My vision is also knowledgenow, being our pair programmer, because it knows the objectives. Because we had a planning session, right? We have a planning session. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nKnowledgenow knows all the details of that planning session, and it knows how to code. So what better buddy for coding the tasks than the guy that is at every meeting paying attention to every single word, making the logic work and filling the gaps? It is not on yukuba to make that work on this first prototype. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI just want to make that very clear. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBut that is the vision, and that vision requires planning. So we'll get together tomorrow and plan that out. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'll be either joining or asking. If you make a call tomorrow, we'll see what Paige say about the content call. We'll try to fit in. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHey, I'll make it work. I don't care. It needs to be tomorrow. Whatever time it is, I'll make it work. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf I am available tomorrow since 06:00 a.m. To even 09:00 p.m. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo all the day. Perfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAwesome. That's great to hear. Thank you. Hubert. What's your availability looking like tomorrow? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI'm always available in the morning around 02:00 p.m.. GMT. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, cool. Till 02:00 p.m.. GMT. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI'm sure we can figure it out and make it work. Questions? You guys have anything you need clarity on? I'm happy to look at any of the projects. We're setting up that workshop for icebreakers. So I'm going to set up an airtable function in your code. Cuba for the personalized outreach system starts logging all the icebreakers into airtable. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSpeaking of outreach, maybe we talk about this upwork system. I just try to bring that up. Would I have it? And we might talk about setting up the upwork group from whoever wants to be in this initiative. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, that's a fantastic idea, man. Give me 1 second, I'll be right back. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. Batek? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHave you started developing the opoque arteries system. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOnce again? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHave you started developing it? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHave you started building it? The system ophook outreach system where I built that. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHave you started building it? Have you started developing it? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I have version one already working. It's on make, just show it in a second to open it. This old stuff. Share the screen? I cannot share the screen until Alayo lets me. We gotta wait. I'll be right back in 1 minute. All right, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, we're good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIn 1 minute. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. Can you let me share the screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou're good now? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, I cannot share the whole screen. Right. I have just so many tabs open you cannot imagine and I need to choose one now. All right, here it is. You see a data table now. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo in general, this thing goes into airtable and gives the title of the job, a description of the job, reason why it's relevant. Because there is also AI that assess the relevancy of this job in terms of my skills, or it can be agency skills or what the agency doing or whatever. And then this is the V one. I didn't even put much effort into this icebreaker thing, so it's kind of generic. But the plan is to make that also generate the proposal. I have a GPT for that works quite good in generating those proposals. I will have to connect that with the system and later it will already generate the proposals. And maybe later we find out how to automate sending of those proposals too. But on the other hand, I'm not sure about if we wanted that from the start. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFrom the start we want rather a human to check it out because upwork requires connects to apply for the job. So you need to actually pay a few dollars to apply for the job. So maybe it will better not to automate that fully, but the search is definitely perfect for automation. So what do we have here? Is Rs fit for automation related projects? We're parsing that, going to the GPT, parsing again and checking relevancy if it's relevant. So it's actually a finding the JSON here because the result needs to be true and the result is the reason from here. So it's say like you're having jobs true or false in json format and then it goes a bit of fusion prompting and then the result should be like this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo when the job is not relevant it goes result false and this is the actual output. I mean this is the problem. But this is how the output looks like. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLike that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo you go, the result is false. So in here it would just stop in here. Basically this is the right. Cool. How do I go back from here? Yeah, so result is true, then it goes to the router and if not, then it just stopped right there. So let's run it for a second or maybe I'll just go over the prompt here in full. What we have here more. Then we have the reason like this is about and an icebreaker. And those are negative example. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nEach of those is an example. Interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is futures prompting inside of meg.com because you have user assistant user basically simulating the conversation. And then we have results. True. And then there is icebreaker coming up. And this is actually one of the proposals I written by hand, not by hand, but with AI and then review by hand. So let's have that run. I should have that going all around, but saving some tokens. So let's have today and let's have say 3 hours before. So we'll have the freshest stuff going on and then it will just go. As you can see, we got two of them actually. Everyone was relevant, so one wasn't. Eight results, five relevant. It's all appearing over here. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd it just should. Right. AI generated comments for LinkedIn post. Interesting. LMA development. Good. Yeah. So that's how it goes. We got a chat bot and then we can have a link for now. It's quite clunky still because it's v one, obviously. Yeah, maybe I should just stop that. We got already tier t results and as you can see those tier t jobs and we have tier t jobs relevant. We didn't have to actually go and look at this and read it ourselves. That's one thing. Another thing. We just basically now going to go to your table and just look at those 13 jobs and then see if they're actually good to apply. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. That's pretty cool, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. And also in the template I was doing it from, there was the get budget regular expression, but it's not working correctly now. I will be working on fixing that. So later you could also have another router and you could have hourly jobs and fixed price jobs separately. But it's still working overhill, adding all the jobs into one place for now. Oh, we got a project with vector database custom GPT. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWould you look at that? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWould you look at that? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt was 60 minutes ago, man. This is the point of this automation is we get freshest stuff out of. Yeah, they basically want vectorbase connected to custom GPT. I'm not sure if there are GPTs. They mean this could be just an instance of chat GPT API lank chain though. The price is fixed. They usually put this hourly rate. This could be hourly rate. They sometimes do like this fixed price. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFor hourly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's definitely hourly rate. Some clients are lazy to click the other option and just write whatever. And to be honest, I'm not sure if I would apply to this. He's already interviewing people. Yeah, sometimes these things happen very fast. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTwelve minutes ago, deserve those. Feel like they're all bots. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's look at the other one. Here we have. That's more appropriate price. You ain't going to get much money from upwork. This is just like get a client, get a job, get some quick bucks and that's it. Not, that's it actually, because you can upsell. I think the biggest actually thing in working on upwork would be upselling. We have this decline now in us that's from chatbots for very little money and very simple stuff. But later, now we have project for possibly way more and possibly a few months of working with the client on a retainer basis. Cool. So I'm thinking of it as another funnel for getting bigger clients. Also, while still we can also try to make some bucks on these jobs, we can definitely filter out those $40 jobs, not this $180 jobs. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe could either decide that, okay, this could be client just type hourly job instead, or we could just filter out those type of jobs at all. Like just filter them out. Not even look at those. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's yet to be decided. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou will be dealing with the famous Ferris NASA. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm trying to find some better job. This is hourly ongoing. Yeah, I think we should make. If there are people who want to do that in fasterized because you can also make agency profile on upwork. Oh no, I think we should make fasterized agency. We will be also making celebrities agency. And also I think everybody who want to be involved should also have their own profile, also looking on their own. And we need to make as big net like phishing as possible because there is not only proposals, also people inviting you for the jobs. So the more profiles we have, the better chance of getting more leads. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, no, this is a really good point. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, let's park it for now and maybe on the next gen exec ask people who want to join the initiative. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo if we look at those draft proposals, we adjust them. We give it as examples for many shot prompting one end and then on the other end. Each of us have our profile. I already have my profile, Pedro already has her profile, Henry already has his profile. We get profile set up for everybody else. We sort of coalesce into an agency. What else are we really doing? Since now the proposals will be much better because we actually reviewed and gave a bunch of good examples. We all have our profiles, we all give each other recommendation letters. What else would be needed on like an active day by day or week by week basis? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe should have some work history, kind of, let's say all the projects, because my work history on upwork is just all the syllabus projects currently, all the projects we've been doing for past half a year, even if some of them wasn't really delivered fully, if there was something that I make, it was working, I just put it there. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, so maybe we do a workshop together and we just do it in one go. And in that workshop we help each other set up the profiles. Whoever needs to set it up from the beginning. I, for example, need to put in projects, well, the description of the project, and we can help each other make the best descriptions that we can make sure that we all give each other recommendations as opposed to like Async, go create your upwork profile, because it's pretty tedious. The ROI seems to be there, but it's pretty tedious. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. I think everybody come prepared with their story because there is, how to say, like a framework to achieve the sales goal, to get the client to offer you the job while keeping us close to the truth, but showing you in the best light. So for example, I have a little stretch out on my experience because I've been programming for three years, almost four years, but in my profile there is like, I'm freelancing for three years already, but I'm freelancing for like one year and a half. And everybody should come prepared with the story. I mean, I actually have some little, but I have some experience to show off. For example, I was talking with Hubert. He doesn't have those past things he done before syllabus or maybe before. He was also in a group of my learning groups in the past. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut the reason, what I'm talking about this is, I say, hubert, you need to have your story, like bring your story of how you come to this place where you are developer now and make that believable for your clients. When they will be reading that, they need to believe that, okay, this guy done this and this. So now he's capable of doing my job. So I think, yes, we should maybe do that together, the profiles. But first, everybody should think about this story. Have given really a good thought to make the story believable and make the story defensible. Like if somebody asks about something from that story, the person should, without second of hesitation, just respond, yeah, I did this and this and yeah, because I can do that for my story. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNow everybody else need to craft their story so they can also do the same. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThen Bartek, let's simplify so we can move forward. So let's ask, we'll plan the workshop soon. So we already have two workshops that we need to do next week and then by the week after. So two weeks from now, people come with bullet points of their story and be it a GPT that puts the story together and then we edit it. Or maybe you brought a few paragraphs and we challenge each other to how we can make it better. Let's make sure that I think everybody. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShould start from thinking how you can feel your LinkedIn profile, how you can feel your work experience to make yourself believable, to be the. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nKind of like. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBy, I think GPT can handle that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSorry to interrupt you, but I think it's GPT agent can handle with make LinkedIn profile. Can or cannot can help. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAt least advise you. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, for sure. There is the natural sound of human writing, which GPT, unless you're prompting it really well, won't quite capture, however, a great first draft that then you put your tone on it because you already know your experience. Hey, I worked here. I worked on this project and work on that project for this workshop in two weeks. Let's have people show up with at very least some bullet points, if not having already worked on their LinkedIn profiles, which is also going to be critical for all of us. Regardless of anything, having good LinkedIn profile is important and then we can transfer those elements to upwork. LinkedIn is a platform that people are very familiar with, so the lift from actually updating your LinkedIn is a lot lower than go figure out this new platform and then we just transfer it over. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo let's do that. It's like, hey, bring your story and go into your LinkedIn and update whatever you want to update. Yeah, cool. So let me write that downwork workshop in two weeks. Link, update at least one thing in your link. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWe'll take it like that. Bring your story even in bullet points and update at least one thing in your LinkedIn. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSeems cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLet's see. Thinking. Awesome. Thank you for that effort, man. It looks like a really cool system. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we'll continue working on that. I think we would have multiple versions running, for example, for agency and for particular people because I think we also should map, I don't know about how it's going with the competency matrix, but I think we should definitely, at least developers that want to do the upwork thing, we should map out all the skills we have and kind of make the profiles of each one of us, specialize in something, and then all of the group cover all of the stuff that we want to do. But the profile should be specialized. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThese are all things that feel like great ideas for workshops that we do together, synchronize. So we're on the same page. We all understand the same criteria of level of experience. For example, competency matrix, maybe even in breakout rooms. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think more of like going deeper, like the particular tools. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause people making the job or searching for a freelancer might be looking for a specific tool. And if you get a freelancer that say, I specialize in this tool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen you're going to take this one. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo we have the air table. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHave the competency matrix to then say like, oh, this person, like this person should apply for the job. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Oh, that's cool, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. I love how this is coming together. A lot of work to be done, but we have the right tools, we have the right people. Bartek, if your client says, hey, let's start tomorrow, update us. Your time availability is very important that we know so we know when to rely on you because we want to rely on you because you're somebody that is reliable and you have many skills and many ideas and a lot of vision that all of us are going to benefit from. And hopefully it goes the other way too. So if availability changes at all, please let us know. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd we'll get together tomorrow and plan knowledge now. And yeah, there's definitely work to be done. Hooby, I would say within the next 24 hours before we meet, get some lang chain brushed up on and get ready for a small prototype. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I'm still training with that. I think I can handle it in few days. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, a few days sounds great. When I say small product. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI can try since tomorrow, but I. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCan promise that tomorrow is a planning session. Yeah, exactly. So tomorrow's planning session. You're going to have time. We're not going to put you in a time pressure. We'll also put a deadline, a reasonable deadline. So there's something that you're working towards. But just know we want to make this work for you. Tomorrow, it's knowledge now, next week, it might be another project, or it might be the next version of what you worked on. Whatever helps build these two skills that you mentioned. I want to work on Python and Langchain, and we have some cool projects to help you build those skills. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSeems fine for me. Really good. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThanks. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor today, I think I advise you to go over the project of outage system. And as I mentioned, I don't know if you started that, but as I mentioned before, you can just copy the cells, just don't copy the API. The API key to the chat, and have to explain every line of the code, what it does here, what it does there. And if you go over this whole automation we have for the outreach system, I think you'll get things tomorrow. All right. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I think that's a great idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSort. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nGetting an understanding of the step by step of the outreach system. Great suggestion, Bartek. I'm going to drop in the discord and tag you with Hoobi. There's a GitHub, and there's also a Google Colab. I tagged you on the Google Colab. A lot more digestible. It's piece by piece, cell by cell. The GitHub is 600 lines of code, so it can be a lot to even look at. It definitely was for me. The Google Colab is two lines of code. Three lines of code, two lines of code. So it's a lot easier to follow. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I will check. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIf you need any clarity, we're here. Text us. Text the group chat. And let's keep moving forward. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt. Sure. Think. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCheers, y'all. See you soon. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSee you soon. Bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-07 GenExec Meeting - Client Updates, Dev products, Outreach progress part2cleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nThank you guys for sharing your update on Friday. It makes me very happy to see progress on what you get to work on or what you want to work on. I hear a lot of rag, I hear a lot of lang chain. As you said, kua, Rag is the future. And it's been very exciting to talk to developers this last week. A variety of experiences and expertise and they all say the same thing. It's like Rag is where it's at. Rag is the future, Rag is what I want to learn. So we're taking that strong indication and running with it. We're building knowledge now. First of all, before we step into that because start rallying on, wanted to share an update. I'm working on the real estate automations. I'm working on the free side on the two free real estate automations. When those are ready, I'll share the demo. In the next few days. They'll be ready in the next few days. I'll share the demo. We can make sure we get some testing in together and I will make sure that each of us can follow the exact same process for when we actually have the paid clients that will come through referrals that we can emulate this system for their side. For some of those that might include importing contacts to the follow up boss CRM and just setting them up from scratch. For some of them that might be like, hey, I would like these automations and each of us needs to already know the API and how does the CRM actually look and feel? So I kind of tried to do that last week, but I realized I don't understand it well enough to guide others. So I took a step back, let me work on these automations, finish them, let me fall into the pits of working with any new API and make sure that I set up you guys for success once the money actually comes in. So that's the update on that, on real estate automations client is still very excited. We got introduced to two people that she's working with, the manual follow up boss guy that's kind of importing her contacts manually and her social media person. And we're going to be able to find ways to help in both of those areas. We got some questions around profit sharing and we will make sure that we have a Gen XAc to clarify, to share, to have questions, and to make sure that everything is clear. It's very important to us, to all of us, to each of us, that we know what's going to happen with the money once the money hits the account. Right. So we'll make sure that everybody has clarity on that and that everybody agrees. Yes, this is fair.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause we are kind of starting to work this week, probably internally on some content automation. So I think we can actually work simultaneously on the automation for the real estate. We have this idea to make notion integrated with relevance AI. Like make some agents and for example you have idea for your content, you write it in the notion, you have this kanban in notion. And then for example you have this raw idea and then some ideas you want to put to AI to draft. And then that will trigger the relevance AI agent, for example, first kind of EDH version of it. And then basically it would draft a post or whatever and then send it back to notion. So that's where I'm thinking, and we're probably going to start working on it this week if there is a time, if the winds are correct. And I also have updates now from the call just a second ago. I was talking to this guy from the prompt hub and we can have collaboration there, like constant collaboration or whatever. I was talking to him on this kind of note. But the thing that really clicks after this call because I was showing him PFA and the output was kind of short. I mean the use case was for a recipe and for a cuisine, sending and generating recipes. So I see that the details couldn't be there more. But I got thinking like PFA sometimes does that PFA sometimes give a short prompt and you need to regenerate. And I was thinking like we need the swarm, we absolutely need the swarm. It's not a product until we have the swarm. This is just a proof of content. And if user have to know that the prompt is not good, but users won't. So we need to have this. The thing that I'm doing manually, like regenerating, like looking. The prompt is not good. Or regenerating, or saying, like, use more markdown, or make this prompt more detailed. We need a feedback loop for that in the PFA swarm, like some agents doing basically what I'm doing now. So the prompt is too short, the prompt lacks markdown, lack structure. Yeah, we should really go there. And I'm thinking about maybe we could repurpose some of our agent systems. Like, I'm not sure how we can. Maybe we can use the outreach system a little bit to change it in a way that we could have those. Or maybe it's better to make it from scratch. I'm still not sure, but we kind of have this structure already where we have those agents talking to each other. I mean, they are not really talking in a chain, right? Yeah, it's kind of chain of action rather than conversation. I think we need to step into the conversation part where we have some kind of hierarchies. Like this is agent one that making the context enrichment, and then there is another one, let's say in the simplest form, generating. And then we would have some agents that above them and checks their work. And they need to talk, basically. I think we need to make it from scratch.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's get to the point where everybody's on the same page and we can actually make some decisions because there's a lot of things that we don't need to do from scratch. Right. There's a lot of research on communication frameworks that we can probably just grab from an open source and then just tune for the use case of prompt regeneration of EFA. So that's what we will step into. Since we're there. Let's just go there. Cuba. We'll get around to personalized our system and I'll give you an update on that. I would like to ask you, Kuba, were you able to start with this Rac system from the single document transcript? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I created it with pine cone. I tested pine cone and coma system. One with pine cone and one with open source vector database. I'm just testing. Like diverto, cosine, similarities between diversity. I've used the two system. I'll show you demo.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOn the note of databases, I wanted to ask if we have capabilities on the AWS in our developer team or generally, because there is those two things. Like there is the vector databases and the new stuff, and there is the old stuff, the relational databases, non relational databases. And actually, right now we are facing the problem, the challenge, more of them, the problem. Let's see. Challenges, not problems. So we're facing challenge to actually offering the chatbot that will kind of pick four different data inputs into a chatbot interface so the client can basically talk with it. Yeah, I referred to that Us client, and we're thinking if there should be one database out of those four, so we're going to have some data migration and stuff. So I'm just thinking if there may be somebody who already been doing some of those stuff. I saw Kuba actually posting something on the discord about the AWS. So maybe I can ask you if you've been doing some stuff with.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, yeah. During the weekend, I played around using, I created a little QC generator, so I created the front end with extremely, and I hosted it on AWS server. So just like playing around with. Figure it out. Have you been doing some with data migration? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, not yet. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, so maybe we connect later after this call and maybe talk about this more, or are you aware of somebody else having AWS experience? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, because at Nike we worked on AWs. So I have experience with AWS storage. I have experience with limited experience with AWS systems, but they don't feel strange to know. I will ask around. And you're essentially looking for a systems engineer, like somebody that could do potentially a migration. Yeah. Okay, I'll ask around. Knowledge. Now remind me to ask for a systems engineer. Already getting used to it. Basically, we need to do like centralized database for the chatbot interface. Like initial. And that's probably going to be migration. Of the data migration into a data migration AWs into a central database. Okay, let's pause on that and we can talk more about it later. Kuba, the stage is all yours.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I created it with pine cone. I tested pine cone and coma system. One with pine cone and one with open source vector database. Yeah, I'm just testing. Like diverto, cosine, similarities between diversity. I've used the two system. I'll show you demo. So this is like the chart, the knowledge now. So first of all I put in my pocket, let me just keep this. So yeah, remember I told you I'm not going to use Google Colab. I had to use it because number one, it's crashing my system for now because I'm testing, I found a way to build visual code. So this is like the other one I'm building like the version. Colab is great. Colab is fantastic. Prototyping on Colab is a great idea. As we look at versioning and actually making it more usable, that's when we'll transition out. Colab works great for now, but thank you for clarifying. Let me walk you through the code. First of all I imported the meetings transcript using planchain. So this is like the transcript. So I split that it into chunks. So this is a chunk of it.Speaker 1\\nWow, what are those? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nJust the chunk of the data. So this is the total length after the chunk of the data. So I embedded it using open air embedding. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I imported into the Pancon like vector database. So this is the name of the index here. So I just queried it. This is just a normal query like to just get the similarity search. So you just return the most relevant document. So this is it here. When I ask what type of agents can we create? So this is like the documents. So in this document I can indicate how many I want it, but I just listen to just. So now I want to pass the document into an LLM. Once you get the document you can answer my query better knowing the context. So I asked the question again, what type of agents can we create? It seems like the conversation is discussing creating agent for real estate or mortgage learning purposes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is not clear specifically what type of agents they are referring to, but it can potentially be an automated agent. Sorry, an automated agent or a human agent. It is also mentioned that they are trying to reduce the amount of agents, keep the process simple and programmatic. So this is just like for querying it continuously, like putting it in a loop. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAt the very bottom. What's that output? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I want to show you. It's just like keeping it in a loop that I can keep on asking, chatting with it, conversational. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, but what is that result from? The meeting was about implementing automation services. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, this is like from another question I asked actually. Okay, I'm going to show you. Let me. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGreat start, man. This is a great start. That's the one thing that's really annoying about Colab that you have to upload the documents every single time. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGuys, I think like thinking for the first version, for the MVP or proof of concept, I think we should list the most required functionalities we need. So I'm thinking definitely who is saying the stuff like participants. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe're doing that with Firefly. So we are going to have that. Yeah. And if we can do it through zoom cloud, then it'll be even easier. So hold that thought and we will get to that point. We'll talk about that too. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd one thing on the processing side and thinking maybe we should use, I mean, it looks quite good over here, but the beginning of the transcript was weird words we should have. Maybe. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThere are a lot of weird words like in the document. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I'm thinking maybe we should have agent that corrects the words like extract the meaning. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that is already built. I can show you. I want to go from big picture to small picture. And we can talk about the components and the subcomponents. And fixing the transcript is one of those subcomponents. All right, call out. Cool. Let's see what it comes up with. I wonder how stochastic it is. Yeah, that's unfortunate. What if you try it again? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat if you instead of agents say product? Because I think this was about the real estate how to say listing description generator. Right? I saw it in the transcript actually me talking about the first project of celebrities. So I think it's more of a project. Oh yeah, go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou see you need a prompt engineer. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's where that comes in. The prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRegeneration. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nActually. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWow, this is just. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLike imputing, like implementing continuously. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, got you. Let's try. This call was about knowledge. Now could you ask what is the product called. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nFor? The. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow is it used about extract. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd either eight project documentation. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nExtract. Sorry, I didn't get that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExtract and ideate product documentation project. I wonder how well it does with typos summary. So this is just extracting and interpreting the chunks from. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe vector store and the vector data. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat I need now is like using a prompt to guide its output. Instead I'll just type in just request. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe need sort of extractor agent like extract fears and then ask later for something. In this situation we'll have two agents. One is extracting the information required, or even better, we start from what's required for the documentation for this project, from this little extraction. And then another extraction agent knows basically more where we're going with it. So say extracting. Then the documentation agent tries to make the documentation but lacks context. So it goes back to the first agent to the extractor and give me more context on this and this. And then it's kind of a feedback loop in here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Yeah, totally. So we're noticing a few things. We're noticing the quality of the extracted documents from pine cone varied in quality, which is normal. It's only one transcript and the transcript is not even clean, so that's normal. Number two, we're noticing that the output of the queries is limited to only the context that it is given from the low quality extraction of the chunks. So it doesn't have much to work with. What if the next step was giving it more context and using that context to actually create a proper answer? Yes. And then number three or number four is the prompt regeneration so that the query being asked can be regenerated, say, by PFA, based on the context of essentially who's asking. In this case, let's just say it's the normal quote unquote faster ICE is asking. So just answer, faster ICE. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWho is faster ICE. Here's who faster ICE is. And we just feed the knowledge base of faster ICE. So there are some components there. Thank you, Kuba. This is a great start. Man. This is wonderful. I wanted to be able to visualize these components, so let's pause so we can keep going forward. So we talked about a lot of things last meeting. It was brainstorming session, and we're taking all these ideas and all these use cases and we're running with it. So let's make it a little more visual. Number one, the thing that we know for sure, which is at the end of a. Sorry, I'm trying to remove the captions. They're in the way. Okay, well, it is what it is. At the end of the day, what we need is answer. Sounds obvious, but how do we get. So let's see. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think we definitely need to let PFA into the wild. I'm actually tired with the GPT's version now. Today is really. I agree. Making me angry about this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGood. Get angry. Create new from that anger. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's make it into the wild. Yeah, I'm thinking it would best if, for example, in this collab we would have PFA as a hint text. Can you imagine writing prompt and in real time it gets like autocompletion hint text kind of thing. How do we do that? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI like that. Okay, that's a whole different component. Let's figure out where that fits, because that probably fits here somewhere. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, knowledge. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNow let's start from the end of it, which is the answer. And I want to dig into this a little bit because, Bartek, you and like connected earlier today and we threw out some great brainstorming. I want to make sure that everybody's with us because we said some really interesting things that we could do with knowledge. Now, we talked about a little more space. We talked about a bot that measures messages you with your to dos say the call ends, we're in a dev meeting. At the end of this dev meeting, the objective for each of us is to have clarity on which of these tasks of this whole system that we're going to look at. We are tackling, it's a subcomponent of a component and we're going to make sure that we are each set up for success. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat that looks like with knowledgenow in the future, with knowledgenow, is that right after the meeting we can get a list of to do's. It's like, hey, this is what you're working on and these are the subtasks that you have to. Oh, right, okay. Yeah, thank you, Hubi. We'll get you the recording and we'll make sure that you have a clear task to work on. So at the end of the meeting, Hubi that now has to leave will get a list of tasks that he has to get done and maybe he's not super clear on what those tasks really mean. So you can message the bot to catch up on the meeting, get clarity on the meeting. That's kind of one use case in itself. So number one, great. Another use case is at a dev meeting. We have a new project. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe're talking about knowledge. Now we figure out the objectives of knowledge. Now we figure out the use case, right? So let's say it's this first use case. We figure out the success criteria, that it actually messages each person after the meeting. That it's clear on the tasks, that the tasks are actually what we talked about, that they're assigned to the right person. So we set up this success criteria and we figure out the step by step. This whole thing that we're doing now is going to be that step by step. So all that knowledge exists in the meeting. After the meeting, there's already a prototype being built. So that might look like a documentation writer. A documentation writer. It might look like a project manager, multi agent, anybody. It might look like actual programmers. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's make digital twins. Of all the dev team partners of. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll the dev team. Hey, I am good at this, but I want to learn rag. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGreat. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNow you have a Bartech digital partner that is an expert at Rag and can help you build those projects while guiding you through it. Because code, in the very near future we won't even need to write. But systems design is something that we need to keep honing in on Cuba. The fact with the personalized outreach system, the fact that were able to throw you a picture of the system that we wanted, and you were able to write the code to put each agent and how it would work together, what tools each agent would need. That is freaking awesome, man. I believe that in the future. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat'S. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGoing to be a minor value added, which is huge value today, that the great value is going to be able, it's going to be in coming up with the system in the first place. So say we have a call and we come up with this system, and by the end of the meeting, there's already a prototype being built, there's already documentation written. The steps, the project manager figure out the steps because of the objective and the success criteria that we set up and the programmers are already working on it. Kuba, you wanted to add something? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo, what I'm thinking is we can actually build all this. All we need is I was watching videos on Poai and it's very cool. It can enable us to do this. That was saying like the documentation writer, the projects manager, the programmer, then we have like a supervisor for all of them. Supervisor is the one that will be assigning the rules when a query comes in. So the supervisor understands that. Okay, this message belongs to the documentation writer. Okay, let's say agent. Then this rule belongs to the project manager. Agent. It's just like routing h query to the right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSomething like perfect. Okay. Yes. And that exactly fits in with what Bartek was mentioning of. Hey, we need somebody to kind of moderate and manage the conversation. Could you text what that service thing that you were looking at is called? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe service Aws. Is that what I mean? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm not familiar. Could you write it? You were watching something that does this? Did I capture that? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, yeah, I was watching like a video. That's what I was saying. Like a video on YouTube. You know this guy Matthew Berman now? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHe'S like an AI influencer. He did a video about it, about the framework. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. Could you post it in the chat and we'll definitely take a look? Yeah, thank you, man. Great. And having other frameworks that we can get inspired by is a great idea. It's not a great idea. It's necessary to figure out what others have worked on and how we can make it better for ourselves. Another one that we threw out there is a scrum master assistant, which you can kind of call a project manager. It's a type of project management, but earlier, and we mentioned it last week, at the beginning of faster eyes, we had this sort of scrum format, and then it was really hard to keep up with because there were a lot of people and there were very few people. It was mostly like Henry and I and most dev calls. So this kind of fell off. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut if we can have this, and I wonder if this scrum master assistant mixes in with messaging you with your to Dos, that you can ask the scrum master assistant for clarity on what your tasks are and the programmers on how to, and creating a draft for that task that then you can go and make better. So this all comes together really beautifully to work together as different components, different use cases working in harmony. So we're coming up with these use cases. Okay, what are the steps to get there? We know a few things. We know that before the answer happens, we need a good evaluation of the answer. How close is this to a full, accurate, relevant answer? Is this an agent? Is this a second moderator that can then kick it back to supervisor? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe'll figure out how these components play together, but we definitely need an evaluation before we ever send any answer out. We're also talking about a supervisor agent. We can call it whatever we want. I'm going to put supervisor, moderator. Who is this supervisor moderating. What is that conversation that is being moderated and what information gets. We know the output, right? It's an evaluation. And the final answer, what is the input? Well, we have the knowledge base, and this knowledge base has information about all these things. We have real time Zoom call transcripts, close to real time. Every other transcript we have about who we are and what we do, knowing skills of each person and what each person wants to specialize in, like rag and knowledge of the project, et cetera. There's a bunch of things, clients, industry focus. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's part of the input. We also have the initial prompt. Okay. And now that we know the prompt leads to the knowledge base in what exact capacity? When is the repropting? Let's figure that out together. So. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think the PFA form framework is pretty reusable in here. We can have the input like you write a prompt, you make a type or whatever later. We have like a context enrichment. So basically, just like PFA enriches your input, this can also enrich your input. And then it's kind of trying to get maybe using the fasterized knowledge base. Like, okay, see we are in fasterized right now. This guy asking me for this and this. Now I enrich this to be more relevant to pastorize the query itself. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, exactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then next thing we have is innovative angles. We not use that in here. Next thing, I need to come back to the diagram. I already don't have it on my whiteboard. So first time I'm going to look at the actual photos of the whiteboard. So let's get back there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe are putting the output to be kind of enriched prompt. So I wonder if there's a knowledge base and then a base kind of system prompt about sort of very brief, like a paragraph about fasterize. Right. Because how do we make sure that if the prompt doesn't mention anything about AI, fasterize any projects, anything. This also has the context of what faster is. What is the global context? Maybe there's some component here of global context. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think we need to have two separate knowledge base calls. Like let's say. So we would have first, before the transcript knowledge base comes in, need to be the fasterized knowledge base. And actually the knowledge base from transcript will be after enrichment. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think that's exactly what I was thinking. Okay. I love how this is coming together. So we go from prompt to global context knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nActually, enrichment. Enrichment first, before you get to the global context, you have to fix the typos and enrich the input. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, got you. I wonder if it's because you are. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAlready querying the global context with this prompt that comes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. So, so we put vanilla PFA to fix the prompt without other context. Maybe like slight context in its system prompt. Vanilla PFA. The whole point is enrich fix. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nActually the enrichment agent could be having the faster. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nKnowledge base in the enrichment agent knowledge. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, question. When we're talking this component from the initial prompt, are we already talking multi agent? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI guess. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, we'll put a maybe in there, maybe already multi agent wondering if we need to do the heavy lifting without even putting the global context in already. But that's minor. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nActually it's even better when we have multi agent system from the start. And then this enrichment is an agent. An agent can have its own knowledge base and that would be the global context. Because actually I doubt thing. Now the enrichment without the context I don't think would be good enrichment. So the enrichment agent already needs to know the faster. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think your GPT without any context is pretty freaking good. Like excellent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, but if it knows where we're going and from where we're coming from, actually the fasterized knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think it will enrich even better. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, so then would this step be redundant because we're going from prompt to add global context into PFA? It's not a rhetorical question. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think the global context has to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBe. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIn the context of context enrichment. The context enrichment agent has to have the context to enrich from. It's kind of like meta enrichment. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, no, I'm with you. I'm with you on that one. Okay, so the PFA specifically, we're talking about the context enrichment agent with general knowledge of general context. General context. So that's my question here. And then we throw that into the global context knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, actually this gets merged. This global context gets merged into the first step as a knowledge base. So we don't have a separate call. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLater. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIn the air. We don't calling the knowledge base by itself. We're calling it through the context management agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, so go something like this then. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I guess we can have it like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd this is a draft. It has lots of room for improvement. But yeah, this makes sense. There's a simple not well written prompt. We have global context and PFA. The heavy lifting in this case is done by the context and reinstrument agent with the general context fixes and enriches the prompt. Maybe it's already multi agent, maybe it's one. Good. Well, it's PFA, so yes, multi agent. Great. Wonderful. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNext step will be extractor agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIs that within this component? Because this component. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, it's next step. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nActually I'm looking at the diagram for the PFA swan, but we're going to have. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNext time. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I don't know if you will be able to see that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Cool. I love blurry. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI don't know if you can read that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI cannot. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nContext. And then maybe I'll just share with. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe image later if we can get something kind of in the Figma board. Maybe just throwing the word. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMaybe I will draw this again because this is kind of mess in here. I had it on my wireboard for a few days and I was just adding stuff on top. So I will redraw this from scratch. Awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Even just getting like a general idea of what the swarm is going to be like. Because we know what PFA is and we know what swarms are. Right. We get the general idea. Okay. So there is now an enriched prompt that comes from the initial prompt and the global context. PFA creates that enriched prompt. What happens next? You mentioned a extractor agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAn extractor agent has the transcript as a knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHas transcript. So it has the full knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe kind of shift the usual way of calling the knowledge base. We have like every agent has the knowledge base, right? I mean, maybe not every, but definitely these two agents have a knowledge base. And he would be extracting from his knowledge through the prompt that we enriched before. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo this prompt gets passed as a rag query into the knowledge base. Is that what you're saying? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's passed to the extractor agent. Then extractor agent gets to the rag. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I think I'm following now. So the extractor agent will intake the enriched prompt and make it a query adapted for rag. Optimized for rag. Yeah. Okay, cool. So the output of this is query optimized for rag, which as we know, it's done. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nActually, wait, we have that already. This is output of the first agent. Well, the query optimized, I think that's. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nKind of a question because this prompt is going to be like, tell me about the real estate project. Then we add the global context into that. And then this enriched prompt, this outfocus, just on the output would have, tell me about the real estate project. This is kind of like what I'm interested about it. Be very explicit about the step by step, be clear about what the client wants. Taka, taka, taka. So the enriched prompt, based on that global context, based on the initial prompt, and the PFA extractor agent may or may not have to do multiple calls to get. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's where we're going. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMultiple queries to the knowledge base in order to actually extract all the components that the enriched prompt is talking about. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo we're kind of going like, Gemini produces three outputs and lets you choose. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNext we have agent that chooses the best version of the output of those queries. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo then with all that. So the PFA extractor agent is going to come up with multiple queries. Multiple queries optimized for rag. We call the knowledge base with each of those queries and the output of that. Man, this is fun. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt goes to the supervisor now. And then we have a feedback loop. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou mentioned something different, which was, we need an evaluation of all that data, all the answers of the queries. And I just want to make sure that we're on the same page, that the supervisor will lead the free for all conversation where now agents are just talking with each other and the supervisor decides what is relevant for it. Okay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, so now it's evaluator. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo it's the evaluator agent which will evaluate the quality, relevance, et cetera, of all the outputs of each kind of sub query to the vector database. And the output is going to be output. Let's keep it simple for now. These are the most relevant. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCan also add a scoring in there, like from one to ten. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. Score one to ten. And we can start with top three. So let's say that ten chunks are extracted for each query out of the vector database and we do top five out of those. Top ten. Based on what? Well, the input is going to be the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nEnriched prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. The global context. It's going to be all the queries each query. Let's call it sub query or rag query. Yeah, let's do that. Rag query. Each rag query and the global context. Maybe there's some other stuff in there, but that's good for now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm thinking if we should add transcript in this one or there should be like separate agent that is focusing on rereading the transcript to kind of check the evaluator or if the evaluator should also do that. But I think that will be too much job for evaluator. We also pass the transcript. We need to think about the context window here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, that's where it starts getting interesting and let's experiment. That's where I say, let's see how many tokens we can spend. And then when we get the best output, we can, we reduce, we simplify. Yeah. So, yes, to all your ideas, let's have a kind of, I'm not going to get too meta, but kind of an evaluator to the evaluator. So let's let the supervisor in now to say what is needed from here. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMaybe we can also add like transcript. I'm thinking like kind of code review to the evaluator, but it's a transcript review. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTranscript review agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo this is kind of a tester. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, it brings back the whole transcript and slashes that with the evaluator output. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd kind of make a semantic check on the evaluator. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nKind of semantic quality check on the evaluator. Cool. So as we are testing the system, this will definitely be necessary because what if the evaluator is the one that's wrong? Right? What if the evaluator is the one that. So part of the input that this transcript reviewer is going to need is kind of its own examples. Here's the whole transcript. Here's the query here are the relevant chunks and we can kind of give its own few shot prompting. I'm not going to call it knowledge base right now because we have way too many knowledge bases to keep track of, but few shot prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, but that's good. I mean, like every agent should have a knowledge base and every knowledge base should be different. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, I agree with you. Let's keep fuchsia prompt for now and we can go from there. Fuchsia prompt of query plus transcript plus relevant chunks plus score from one to ten. So tester of QA agent transcript. There you go. QA agent, which will do like a check on the evaluator agent. Okay, I'm going to pause now because I want to be considerate to all the other human being in this conversation because I feel like we're robots right now. Kuba, what clarity, what questions. Maybe everything's clear, but I know sometimes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI go off in, to be honest, I enjoyed the conversation. I like the way you guys think. This is like a new picture to the entire system. So I understand. I just need to go over the stigma body again to understand it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Awesome. Well, if you have any questions, there's the chat, whatever comes to mind, ideas, feel free to pitch in. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRefinement loops, definitely in the evaluator to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe extractor, my mind. So before you go into that, Kuba, you asked me the other day, what's the thought process for these icebreakers, for the personalized outreach system? And I mentioned this reinforcement learning with human feedback, or at least trying to emulate that self refinement getting better over time. And this very much we want to go in that direction with this. So that's where the QA agents might come in too, right? How do we make sure that this system gets refined over time, that it doesn't hit a ceiling. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOr at least. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDelay the ceiling as long as possible? So you're talking self refinement, which sounds like a branch from the QA agent, may or may not. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe evaluator agent, an evaluator agent into the extractor agent. And also I'm thinking like this is refinement on the process one time. But I'm thinking we could also have agents that if the refinement happens, so the initial output was somewhat wrong because maybe not always could be wrong, maybe sometimes it will just go fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd the evaluator has nothing to say, QA agent has nothing to say. But if they have something to say, we should save that and have agent that keeps track of the refinements that happened and use that as later maybe knowledge base. Oh fuck yeah, dude, let's go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, that sounds like we're wondering like hey, where does the supervisor get into the conversation you just mentioned? Sometimes there might be like space for the self refinement agent, for the Q agent, and we might need to go back or reroute the conversation. So now we know a point where we want a supervisor to say hey, who's next? And it will have obviously knowledge of each agent, what they do, maybe a summary of their system QA. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe QA agent needs to also report the supervisor agent like the evaluator agent do. And then supervisor makes the refinement loop. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd now the supervisor. And now we start routing. Okay, so we get, oh, we ran out of figma board. We have the evaluator agent, then the QA agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo we can go either to the evaluation or to the extraction from supervisor now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we have PFA extractor which creates multiple queries optimized for Rag. Then we have the knowledge which goes to parts of extraction from the knowledge base. We have the evaluation of that answer. What are the most relevant chunks then QA agents. We haven't defined yet what we do with these chunks. Trying to answer the prompt, right? So if we don't forget about what the user is asking, we're trying to answer the prompt. We now have the most relevant chunks to answer the prompt, at least we think we do. We pass it through the QA agent and we confirm yes, we have the most relevant chunks. Are we ready to answer the query? No. What is missing? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo we need like aggregator agent that, wait, it's aggregator agent or something else. We just need to now get these things that come out of the evaluator or QA agent and have a path downwards I guess to the, something should happen before the answer is now. And now we have evaluator that has scored the outputs and now those best scored. We need like a merger agent, I think that will take the go ahead. The merger agent could take the best scoring from the evaluator, best scoring answers and then analyze them. Let's say there is the best chunk, but in the second best and the third best chunk there is also some stuff that is not in the first chunk. You hear me? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo the manager agent take the best pieces out of the say three most scored chunks and takes the best pieces into the answer. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. So take the best chunks from evaluator agent and create a full answer for each rag query. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMerging the best pieces, now merging the best pieces. It's good now? No, it was good. You just add it at the, yeah, you take the best chunks and then for each rack query you merge the best pieces from those chunks. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBest pieces from each chunk. We will work on the wording later because we are following. Okay, the merger agent takes the best chunks from the evaluator agent and creates a full answer for each rag query by merging the best pieces from each chunk. Okay. And merge the best pieces from each chunk to create a full answer for each rack query. Awesome. We're going to put the self refinement agent somewhere around here and we're going to start creating the routing function, essentially, which is most likely literally a function call with the input being which agent is next, if that makes sense. Kind of like the tool is function calling for routing to most relevant next agent to continue the conversation. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think that the supervisor is actually making those loops back to where it was the mistake, but the self refinement agent is more of like, I would say it's like a self refinement bookkeeper. So the one that keeps track of the refinements that happened and puts them in a knowledge base. So we can have kind of wondering, this is where the self learning happens. Self learning knowledge base is happening right here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. So a supervisor could fulfill that role, technically could fulfill that role because he is keeping track of everything. He is tasked with being like the bright mind that can put all the pieces together and know who to call and kind of know what's missing. At the same time, the supervisor only knows what it knows. It's not necessarily there to judge what it was given. It's tasked with take what it's given and run with it. It's like what's next, not what could have been better. So the supervisor says, hey, maybe there was room for improvement here. That's when the self refinement agent might create a kind of full evaluation of everything up till now and kind of find the blind spots. Which agent it was where the process went astray went wrong. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Now this agent will have a kind of bookkeeper agent that's kind of working. After the self refinement happens, it gets noted to the bookkeeper agent, which then keeps track of all the refinements that happen. So then we would. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFunction more than another agent. It's like it could call the function of bookkeeping. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh yeah. If refinement happens, then call the function to save the refinement process that happened. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf refinement happens, keep a log of full combo into what was wrong, evaluation of what was wrong into improvements suggested. And at the very least for now, let's not let the conversation just loop back. Let's just keep a log and that's going to be great. Training data to know what might need refinement as opposed to creating a crazy loop of agents that might end up no one knowing where to go next or like a feedback loop of bad data. So bookkeeping function, great. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think that supervisor role is to know what to do next from there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nActually, yeah, that's the function. Routing to most relevant next agent. You mean from the self refinement agent? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. So the self refinement make decision what to refine and then supervisor makes a loop to that agent that needs to be refined. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Through all this we have to figure out, you talked about low hanging fruits, we have to figure out what's like. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPriority because that's the big picture now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd this is great, you guys, this is truly going to be the future. Okay, so we know, let's assume that no refinement is needed. What we do know that we need is now a merger agent to take the best chunks from evaluator and merge the best species from each chunk to create a full answer for each rag query. Now that we have a full answer for those sub queries, we need to actually answer the prompt answer formatting agent. Okay, this is where if you talk. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIn one prompt, this is the output format. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then from the merge chunks from the merger agent, it will have a structured output. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI see your mic going on Kuba, if you want to jump in, feel free. Okay, so we have answer formatting agent, but we're running out of figma space. Again, this is great. Okay, so what happens before the final evaluation of the answer? Well, there's answer formatting agent and in between evaluating the answer and deciding how the answer is going to be formatted, there's answer agent. So somebody that actually creates the final answer. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI found blind spot in all of this because the final answer is bot messages you with to do we need a knowledge base with the competency matrix or something like that? Like at least information about who is in the team. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAt very least that's part of it. Knowing skills of each person and what they want to specialize in matrix. Good catch, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut yeah, I think that it should be at the end rather than in here. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo for each different use case, this is something great. This is a great point you're bringing in. It's like, hey, what's the actual use case? But this is not the answer agent. This is the formatting agent. What's the actual use case? What other info might be needed? But then is this, what other info might be needed? The answer formatting or the supervisor. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOr sort of like team manager agent that we are getting the answer, but now we need to actually choose who. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGoing to do what. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFrom this answer we got. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. So we could subdivide this supervisor into other sub agents, like an HR agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOr team lead agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. It would feel slightly redundant to this supervisor because they can have that ability. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm just thinking if it wouldn't be too much for one agent, but let's talk MVP and maybe it will work. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Yeah, it's 02:20 a.m. For me already. But we're in a roll. We're in a roll. And then decide which agent comes next. Right off the bat is keeping track of the conversation, identify what info might be needed and then decide which agent comes next. Doesn't feel like too much. There's going to be other things that we add on top. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAlso. Assign team members. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAssign team members. So what's the actual use case? For example, e. G, for the to do task use case, we would need to check relevant skills. Assign team members. We would need to. What else? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDecompose tasks. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDecompose tasks. Yes, decompose projects into components. Into tasks. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAssign deadlines. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAssign deadlines. Which ideally we're saying out loud during the call. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt'S like deadline for the whole project. Right. We talk on the call, but there is another deadline for the tasks and for the components, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. We then have to figure out over time how much autonomy do we want to give it, even if the output is say, quote unquote perfect, the nuances of humans. And hey, I'm actually quite swamped this week and I'm only now learning rag. So how big of a deadline, how long of a deadline or how big of a task can I really take on? Let's keep that human for now. And the scrum assistant can help with the evaluation, sort of the analysis, evaluation of all of that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we could also have at some point availability checker, something like that. So checks tasks already assigned to the person. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. So like, checks, tasks already assigned. So we need project manager management tool to keep track of this, which is likely going to be notion. So we're actually already migrating a lot of stuff to notion, and we can then automate the project manager within notion. Check tasks already assigned, deliverables missed and delivered, missed. And it can help sort of adapt like, oh, well maybe this person is overloaded right now and kind of like checks capacity and then assigns. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is already fault three we're talking. But that could also be like contribution calculator or whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, contribution calculator. And I actually found a great template to do that. It's an airtable template where you can create a project and then keep progress logging. Yes, absolutely. And maybe even that can be filled automatically during the call live. That'd be cool. Kind of like project automated auto project logging, progress logging. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, and after that we have like a UI thing going on. After the answer we are stepping out of this agent. Now we have UI, so either yes or no. For Vivalan, for example, you get the to do list from this and then you have option to say like yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOr no, yes or no. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMaybe later, like if you take the task or you don't take the task because you get assigned to something the AI already checked. You can do this, but now it's human decision if you want to do. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSee, I see, yep. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNow we're getting to the human, to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe UI confirm task. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think that should be like separate card because we are stepping out of this is not AI anymore. We are going to the UI, to the human. So that should be like another card. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think so. These are use cases. Each of these subcomponents may or may not contain AI. I want to just make sure that we're not now dividing the use cases into what we'll need, just so we can refer back to these and look at the whole use case as a whole. It's going to be very important to be very clear and almost like simplify use cases so we know what the success criteria is of each use case. Yes. Now Knowledgenow completes this to do task successfully. And we don't have such large variations of branches of the use case itself. So I'm putting here confirm task assignment. We'll figure out how that works and where that fits in. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. So. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet'S look at it backwards so we get the final answer. Hey, these are your to Dos based on the project, based on the deliveries that you have the capacity that you have. This is what has been assigned to you. Do you accept these? Which ones do you accept or do you want to review this? Yes, I accept. Contribution calculator comes later. You can message bot to catch up on meetings and get clarity on assignments, which was the first low hanging fruit that we identified even as a subcomponent of this. We asked about this, right? What are the low hanging fruits? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, I think what we should do now, because we have this high level thing and now we should maybe go backwards like you say, and mark the things that are required for the minimal version. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's have this green sticker. Where is things required? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. So we know that the actual output is required and we'll just tag like MVP. That's a little too small. MVP. Bam. Evaluation. We're going to be doing manual evaluation at first. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I think all evaluations can go to the V two. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Answer. Obviously we need answer. It feels like depending on the use case. Well, we're going to start with one use case. So the format is already going to be set. Maybe we don't need an agent to come up with a format to give summaries of meetings that is already set. Then we have merger agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe are doing evaluation. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo no. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSupervisor, I think. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSupervisor. Yeah. We ended up not having any branches. This is all sequential. The only branch is the self refinement agents, which is probably not the MVP. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm sure that a free for all conversation is going to be important, especially for coding tasks. So does this task require multiple agents having an open conversation. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor example. But we are talking like a board of the company. Like, this is the board. And then later if we have some tasks like coding and stuff, we would have another kind of system or swarm. That is the worker agents. Yeah, I don't think the programmers are in this diagram. This should be like another diagram of the worker agents because this is high level. Like a board, like a seaboard. This thing we just built is like a seaboard. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo kind of like, well, I'm just leaving at programming team. So programmer, tester, whatever, which for coding tasks we would need to route to here. You've definitely been watching the has framework. When you throw out the word. This is the board. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe supreme oversight board. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, no, it's a great concept. It's a very well developed concept. So yes, supervisor, moderator board. So these in itself could be a multi agent system because alignment, again, is probably the hardest problem in all of AI. So is this really a single agent question for not the MVP? Okay, we have the evaluator agent, which grabs the relevant chunks for each query. So we need an agent to grab those relevant chunks to grab chunks, period. So that's the extractor. So we need an extractor which will break down a prompt into break down prompt into multiple queries optimized for rag. I think we have something in our hands with you guys. And then, well, the knowledge base will need it, which is not trivial. And then finally, we need contact enrichment, so we need global context. And this is human input. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGuys, I have to bounce. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, we're pretty much done, so thank you for sticking through it. Kuba, great to have you here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe prompt engineering resources that I told you about. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, thank you for reminding me. Bartek. Kuba asked about some prompt engineering resources to sort of keep learning, keep getting better. I think it'll be good for all of us to sharpen our prompt engineering skills. Could you share some intermediate into advanced resources with Kuba? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI already shared at some point the documentations. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDocumentation. Right, right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd the OpenAI guide. That's definitely for me. This is beginner stuff. So if you talk intermediate, I would recommend reading markdown syntax and getting familiar with all the markdown things can, all the things markdown can do and thinking, because that's actually how before going to latent space, because I'm referring to how I upgraded PFA, because first version of PFA is already the documentation level stuff. But then the next version, like the PFA overseer was about, I was reading the markdown syntax and I was thinking, okay, I have this markdown syntax. I know Markdown is using the prompts. How do I use all those things markdown have? Because Markdown have quite a lot of things you can do with Markdown. So getting familiar with Markdown, I would recommend. Definitely. And then later I would recommend for more advanced stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGetting familiar with the latent space activation. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. Like sparse representation and all that stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Also there is actually the latent space activation function written by David Shapiro, so that you can also find it on his GitHub. Also on my GitHub, you can find it's still like not finished, but I've been doing a Vicky for PFA. And in this Vicky, I have a little bit like two kind of little articles about latent space activation from my point of view and from point of view on props engineering. So how to use latent space? What does in writing? Persona for the AI for the sale? You make an agent and you want a Persona, and you want this Persona to be with the latent space activation included. So you can read about this at my GitHub. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I will share the latent space activation video with Kuba. Definitely. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDavid Shapiro. Okay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo, Kuba, I'm sending you two resources to start, and let's evaluate from there if you need, where you feel like you want to go from there, if more into the very specific and advanced Personas, et cetera. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, thank you guys, thank you, Batik. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I'll see you soon and we'll talk about the personalized outreach system. I went in a bit of a rabbit hole of evaluating which LLM is best at refactoring a whole big project into a proper repo that we can actually maintain. So all these different files and all that stuff. But I will add to you by tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, no problem going with your stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'll send you some more documents and we can with a bigger knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGood job, brother. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPrompt engineer. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, so we've got like, 1234 agents for the MVP. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, we have to figure out the use case. There's the answer. Agent one, evaluator, extractor four. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, but the problem is that the first agent is a swarm itself. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSure. It need not be. Remember, you have built an amazing product just by itself, and we're going to make it even better. Dude. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm striving to make it like, don't make a mistake, because now, because of the randomness, you cannot control in the GPTs because you cannot even set the temperature. I'm not even talking about the other parameters, but you cannot even set the temperature. So that's why it's so random. And that's why sometimes the prompt is just like, one line. I hate it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo this is what I'm going to need from you. I need you to pat yourself on the back for creating an amazing product that we are going to put in a whole different category of amazing once it's multiagent. And right now, we really need to focus on creating the bigger product because, again, that's one amazing, but just one component of the whole system. And I am absolutely sure that through these testings, through these. Hey, now create, break down this enriched prompt into multiple queries optimized for rag. You're going to find new things to make better, not from this 8000 character prompt, but how to actually make it into these multiple agents. And then we'll step into that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo let's give it a little bit more freedom by taking it out of the chat OpenAI context window and limitations and putting it into a new environment where it can be a little more free and we'll see what it does. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, actually, I already drafted the prompts for, like, context agent. There is like. Wait, there's context agent. There is the PM agent. Like a pmidation agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm going to write this down. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is the context. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nContext agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen there is the pmidation agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIteration idation. Like ideation and then there is ideation agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. And this ideation agent is like technic choice fusion structure and latent space activation fuse. What? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLatent space and what else? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTechnic choice, like a prompt. Technic choice. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh yeah. Fuck yeah. I love that. So it'll know if it'll go like tree of thoughts or chain of reasoning. That's cool, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's such a good idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI love that. I've had that in my brain for so long. I love that. Okay, awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd it's been on my whiteboard for quite a long time. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then later is the generation agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe what? Generation. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGeneration agent. The actual generation of the prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd that's where I'm at currently. But the ideation PM agent is still work in progress. So I finished the context and I finished the generation because that's what I basically had before. I just had to take that out to the separate prompt. So that's what in my vs code is the current state of the PFA swarm. Later on there will be, obviously after generation there is evaluation and there are the iterator. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. And what we need to do progress. And what we need to do is knowledge. Now remember this, we are checking which agents we've yet to build. And these are going to be the tests of this whole system. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we're calling knowledge now. I love this. Okay. Evaluator agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. And then iterator agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIterator agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen I have still cloudy talk. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nExtractor agent, or we've yet to build. We need to break down a prompt into multiple queries optimized for rag. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. So that's also to do. Okay, extractorate, because that's not part of the PFA swarm itself, it's just part of the knowledge. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight, right, exactly. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then also I got an idea. This is like a very raw idea. Like after the iterator, if you can see that after the iterator, there is prompt levels. Upgrade, swarm. I'm thinking like upgrading of the prompt will be another swarm upgrade. I still don't have that laid out completely because for V one there will be the iterator agent doing the upgrades. But what I'm thinking later, after iterator mechafuse upgrade, we can have levels of upgrades like level one upgrade markdown, level two upgrade complexity. Level three upgrade latent space activation. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that is what I would love us to have as a testing framework of the PFA system. Like talking about that. We can integrate here, of course, but as a whole different system. These multi agents and have the testers be kind of like what you showed in promptful but on steroids. Of course. Evaluation and leveling up. So is that what we're doing for MVP? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's poultry or something. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, so I'm then going to put this in green and it's MVP. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd then we will have like a testing upgrade swarm for later testing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUpgradeswarm. And that's going to be V two. Okay. No, the other way around. V two is going to be testing an upgrade swarm with levels E. G. One, markdown two. What would level two be? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nComplexity or like details. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDetails. Three, accurate context capture. Okay. Anyway. Oh yeah. Actually run on the environment. Actually run the code and we'll figure this one out later. This is not V one, the programming team. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInput we have. So what do we need to do? We need to do the for agents, this is what we need to do. And then for other stuff we need global context. We need knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, I got a beard. Back 1 minute. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, we need answer agent. And I'm glad we budgeted $800 for a fast rice. This is going to get fun. Make a message bot to catch up on meetings, declaring assignments. You discord. Discord. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight, amak? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Okay, so this is what, let's sum. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nUp what prompts we need for those agents. So prepare those prompts for the MVP of the knowledge now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOne sec. And then answer agent. And then for other stuff is the global context, the actual knowledge base which I'm working on. And then the discord bot, webhook. Love it. This is looking so nice. Prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTo have four agents. The context enrichment is like 90 or 80% done because I had it done for PFA. So I would just tweak a little bit for the knowledge now. So it's enriching in the transcript case rather than prompting case. Yeah. Later we have the query agent, the rag query agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhich is the rag extractor. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAha. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen we have evaluation in V one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe evaluator agent that will actually. So the rag query extractor agent, the rag query agent will create the queries from the prompt and then the evaluator agent will say, these are the best chunks from that. Extract from that cosine similar. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut the iterator agent is for. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, you mentioned that would be V two. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut now I'm talking about the knowledge now. So yeah, for the PFA there is an iteration agent. Right. But I'm talking about knowledge now because I'm thinking about the prompts needed for the knowledgenow system. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm talking about knowledge now, too. But you had mentioned an iterator. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, it's for PFA swarm. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, PFA swarm. So that would be an iterator because. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI thought like, both of these green cards are for the PFs one, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, technically, yes, they are, but this is also for knowledge now. So I'm going to put different colors and we're going to call this V two for V two. This is what we're focusing on now. And the other stuff we're focusing on kind of after we have the MVP, not that we can't keep thinking about it, but in terms of output. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. So the progress part is actually for the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGotcha. Gotcha. Great. So progress, bam, we put here. Great. Thank you for clarifying. And are any of these agents relevant to our MVP, which would be the context agent. Context enrichment agent, which is at 80%. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause for the PFA swarm, it's finished. It's just that I will have to make little different version for the knowledge now. So be more relevant to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEvaluator. Iterator agent was the other one. That was not that. Then evaluator agent, rag extractor agent, query builder agent, and then we have the answer agent. And then for other stuff that we need to have build is the global context, which is sort of a short system prompt kind of style knowledge base. All of our transcripts. All of our transcripts or detailed summaries of our transcripts. It would probably be the full transcripts. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOr the cleaned transcript. Clean from those weird words. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, cleaned transcript. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I think we are going. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI have that code. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think we should be going like one transcript per one use of the knowledge now. Because if you throw all of the transcripts in the one knowledge base, I'm not sure how that's going to go. I mean, you want to extract from one meeting, right? You don't want to extract from every meeting at once. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe whole point is that there is continuity from meeting to meeting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, but at one, say, run of the knowledge, now you're extracting from one particular meeting. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe all meetings is like a global context infrastructure, knowledge base, something like that. In my variant there is the run. It's on a one transcript, and then we have output of that, and that should be saved into the all transcript knowledge base. Not the transcript itself, but the result of the knowledge. Now doing the work, analyzing transcript and then have like summary or something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. I'm not 100% sure. What is the difference? We'll be testing this most likely with a few transcripts. And see what it pulls because there is relevant information for the same question in different days, different meetings. Right. System or knowledge. Now we will limit it because it's a good point that you're bringing. Are you really going to put 100 hours of context of transcript just to grab from a knowledge base? That would be pretty messy and confusing for the rag. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut that is part of why we have the evaluator agent, because it's like, hey, based on the enriched prompt, the rag queries, this chunk that you withdrew, we're talking about AI agents. We're not talking about real estate agents. So this is irrelevant or the other way around. We're talking about a real estate solution. So AI agents doesn't make sense. So the evaluator would figure that out. Good question. Let's test it. Let's get the MVP. Let's test it. We'll figure out what we change and also obviously how we manage our knowledge base, which is going to be garbage in, garbage out. The quality of the data, the underlying data has to be high and we'll do our best to have a solid data quality standard for our MVP and we'll make it better over time. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. And you see that we are making, let's see, the call ends. The transcripts get rendered automatically or you have to do that yourself. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe will be able to render them. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAutomatically and then also we should automatically have them cleaned. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, correct. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd the question is now if we also want them automatically to be pushed into the knowledge. Now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is definitely a pending question because that's what the global context is. Oh my God. Global context is. This is what the dev team does, has worked on, is working on. This is the marketing team. This is who composes the marketing team. The upcoming strategy that say videos published, et cetera, et cetera. And that's the global context that, based on what the original query and the enriched query is, will have certain relevance. So we can create what makes sense to me as a gated access of information to guide. I don't know if that's what you meant by global or global meaning every single component, every single transcript is fair. But we'll figure that out at the start. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf we want to enrich a prompt, let's give it some context and then we can dig into all the details and the transcripts and all that stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I think it also depends on the use case. I feel like some use cases could be done automatically. Like we automatically render the transcript, automatically clean the transcript and let's say for the, to do we also automatically run it through the knowledge now? But I guess some use cases will be like run manually and some use cases will be run automatically. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. So I'm going to write dockup considerations, auto run or human check or fully manual, e. G. Modifying the dev team global context document. Because when a new project comes in and we have a new project we're working on a new project, the dev team global context document needs to be updated, but we want to do a human check. That's like, yes, that's how you should update it. Dev team deserves human check. Okay, cool. Okay. You threw out other considerations there. What was it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI was just saying before about the automation of rendering and cleaning? So I guess that happens automatically all the time. And then we only have differentiation for. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe use case rendering and cleaning. Yeah, auto cleaning, but auto rendering. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd also we can have, how to say, categorizing the transcript into like dev call or marketing call. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe're lucky because Zoom already does that for us. This right now that we're on is a dev meeting. And if you look at the chat. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh yeah, I forget. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd you scroll up, all of our chats of every dev meeting are there, including the summaries. So it's pretty cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd just to be funny, I'm going to ask the AI companion, catch me? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, I think that's the end of my idea for today. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, that was 2 hours of idea knowledge now. So I'm asking the zoom AI companion to give me an in depth explanation of knowledge now. I'm sorry, but the meeting transcript does not provide enough information to give an in depth explanation of knowledge now. So the rag sucks, but this is. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLike the zoom out of the box transcript analysis, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. Okay, I'm going to walk through this real quick and we can close it. So I input a prompt, there's global context about who fasterize is, who the teams are, and who each person is. That context allows the PFA context enrichment agent to fix and enrich the prompt with the context and outputs an enriched prompt. A lot of the word enrich in there. We'll fix that. We'll ask PFA to fix that. That follows into a PFA rag extractor agent, which has full access to the knowledge base. The output of, wait, that goes after the output of this extractor agent is to break down a prompt into multiple queries optimized for rag. Those queries going to the knowledge base, which will be living in pine cone. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd that knowledge base has the most recent Zoom call transcript plus every other transcript we have, it knows skills of each person and what they want to specialize in through the competency matrix. It has knowledge of projects, clients, industry, focus, et cetera. Then comes the evaluator agent because we extracted for each query several relevant based on semantic similarity, based on cosine similarity, several chunks of information. We now need to evaluate which chunks are relevant because if we're talking about real estate agents, AI agents shouldn't be part of the answer that we're integrating, or maybe yes, depending on the automations that we're building for them. So we have an evaluator agent to say, hey, these are the most relevant chunks for each query. This is the score from one to ten for each chunk, and here are the top five chunks. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFrom there we will have a QA agent that will do a full transcript review. So what chunks were retrieved and then do an evaluation of how well did the evaluator agent do its job. We will integrate an oversight board agent that will be able to route to the most relevant next agent to continue the conversation. So we'll keep track of the conversation. Identify does this task require multiple agents to have an open conversation? What other information might be needed? And it will decide which agent comes next, which might be a self refinement agent to log potential refinements to the system. It might be the programming team or most commonly it will be the merger agent which will take the best chunks from the evaluator agent and merge the best pieces from each chunk to create a full answer for each rag query. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEach individual rag query and the final steps are we have answer formatting agent prompt format no wait, that goes at the beginning. We will have answer formatting agent for hey, what's the actual use case and how we make sure we are effective at answering. And there's a big one here who is asking how can we give them a relevant answer that they care about. The CEO doesn't care about the same thing as the engineering manager. So it'll give the output format to the answer agent. It'll grab all of the relevant information and create a final output. Finally, we will have an evaluation answer evaluation agent which will help us keep track of the accuracy of our system. How close is this to a full, accurate relevant system? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe first use case is going to be the first MVP use case is going to be you can message the bot to catch up on meetings and get clarity on assignments, which is going to be one component of our V one use case which is the bot messages you with your to Dos after the meeting, checks the tasks that you already have assigned. Your deliverables, checks the capacity and then assigns the tasks. It will confirm with you which tasks you actually want and can take on. It will actually help calculate your contributions and you can have a conversation with the bot to get clarity on those assignments and do your best work. That's knowledge now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. And also it will attack everybody to make a post on social media. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt will what? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt will attack everybody with a message to write something for the social media. Seriously, I need, like, attackers to attack me every day. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI don't know that attack is the right word, but yes, we need it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's more of a peeing, but I don't know. I want this AI to be aggressively making me write a post because otherwise I won't. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is going to be a huge part of the knowledge base of knowledge. Now don't use the words aggressive and attack. That's funny. We'll cut that out. We'll cut that knowledge now. Cut that last part out. But I'm with you. I'm with you. Let's have something that we're proud to show PFA. You should be proud to show it. The real estate automations, as simple as they will be. We're proud to show it. It's our first client and we're actually delivering something great for them. So let's get on that social media game and let's grind these projects out for now. This is what this project and fastrise needs from you. Bartek working on the agents. Let's get some drafts for these three agents. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCan you send it to me in a chat in a private message? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's exactly what I was about to do. Awesome. So we need draft prompts for great. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd also context agent, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, did I not put that in there? Oh, yeah, you said the context agent was 90%, but yeah, I'll add that in there. It was in a different section. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, because it's finished for the PFA swarm, but for the transcript, it has to be a little tweaked, I think, because it's kind of little different. Context enrichment in case of transcript analysis and in case of prompt engineering, it's a different thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, makes sense. Okay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd do you need any help with the real estate agent projects? Maybe Hubert can help you with that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you. Not for now. Because it would be more lift, it would be more time spent kind of guiding someone through all of the components of number one, the CRM, number two, the API, and then most importantly, what the client wants. And how they want it. So I am going to show, not tell. I'm going to first work on these two free automations that we're making for them. And then I'm going to show Hoobi, for example, and walk him through the final build the output, and then go backwards from there. And we can all work on those. They'll be relatively simple and we all want to make money. So I want to integrate everybody into at least one part of those real estate automations. Yes, awesome. Knowledge. Now. Draft 1 March twelveth 2024. Let that day be remembered. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, and check out the messages I sent you before this call. I found some transcript. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd also those videos. We can use them also for this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool, cool. Lovely. I'll check them out in between tomorrow. I'll check them out tomorrow. I'll find some. Bartek, thank you for your. This is. This has been very fun. I'm honored. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, sure, man. Yeah, happy to work on this one. Seems that it's going to be revolutionizing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, absolutely. We can help a lot of people make better lifestyles, better work, better everything. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTake care, brother. I'll see you tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-12 Dev Meeting - Knowledge Now Final Draft 1cleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nAsk what thinks about it.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis could be white.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nRefactor the whole project into something that even a junior developer could follow, understand and improve upon. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThis is the original code personalized outreach system. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThrough the system we want to create first touch bases with the people we want to connect with. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo retrieve LinkedIn profile. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nExperience in recent posts through the relevance AI API. Read our knowledge base to understand how the profile is relevant to fasterize and its real estate products. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe lead in what ways is this lead? A relevant lead for a business and for our offer. And then icebreakers or hooks based on the LinkedIn profile info and these gold nuggets about who they are and who. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLog all these icebreakers into airtable to then do manual review and make sure that the whole system is aligned with pasteurizes values and what we're aiming for. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThen we draft an email based on prospect profile and a critic agent will. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nEvaluate how human this email actually sounds, if it has our tone, if it has our brand, how well it flows and how relevant it is to the prospect's profile. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd next, the writer agent will rewrite the email, taking all the information that we've created so far. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo it's about 600 lines of code. When you take in the actual person's profile, when you take in the actual knowledge base, it becomes about 2000 lines. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nRelevance AI is an incredible platform where you can create pretty much any tool you imagine. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt barely consumes any credits. So through the relevance tool, we are capturing every detail about the profile.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nMake a prompt for AI that will take a long Python file, understand the project deeply, and break up the code into different files to make a proper repo. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThus, how many and how which files get created needs to be very flexible.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nFeel where it's giving itself instructions, it's requesting itself to enrich the prompt, it's asking itself for perspective, and then it will summon expert agents to help them brainstorm. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWrite a comprehensive readme. Let's see if it can actually write the code. You can move forward. Feel free to take it as autonomously as possible from here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'll start the refactoring process now. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHowever, when I asked it to code each step, each actual file, it did a mediocre job.\\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt's just putting the functions in and saying, hey, here's where the logic goes. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBut the repo that we need is actually a lot more intricate because there's a lot of things going on and we need organization to be a priority. Remember, we need a junior dev to look at the repo and be able to navigate, understand each file, understand how each file interacts with each other, and figure out how can I improve the project. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo Chai GBT didn't do a fantastic job with the same prompt, with the same exact prompt. Now asked Claude to tackle on this project. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnalyze the code, create a new project directory, then intuitive structure.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet's see if it can actually write the code. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWe will refactor the process autonomously and things are going back on in the background, but things are not going on in the background actually. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I have to be great. Move forward. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nStructure setup code refactoring and it's telling. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe things that it wishes it had done or it would do if it had this autonomous something going on in the background sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThe main py file now serves as the entry point of the application, orchestrating the flow by importing and utilizing the necessary modules and functions. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet's go through each file and create an action plan to complete the missing code scrape profile.Speaker 3\\nWord that references as important. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, and there's a model that recalls. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt and there's a model that can't. Let's go, Claude. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nImplemented the code for scraping LinkedIn. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nProfiles using the relevance API, added error handling. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLet's go, dude. Okay, so if we go back. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMake it look more spammy. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSorry. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nPlease now create a markdown tree of the composition of the repo. Let's go, let's go. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWow, that is beautiful, dude. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. Wonder what that code actually looks like. Oh my God, that's beautiful. Okay, let's go to Figma, we can. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nGet her done. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOr we go to visual studio and start a new project. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSpaghetti rock. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDoesn'T say lula now even. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nKnow which repo I'm trying to clone. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet's go baby. Let's go baby. Got shitty. So. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWonder if it would like meta. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCreate a thing of the structure of the project. Be interesting. So I need you to exist a o yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo it's. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. So let's reshare to include code and we have this. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo let's create file by file. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNew file main py. Well, you know where to save it. Dude, why are you asking me? New file LinkedIn, new file LinkedIn scraper, py agents, templates, tools. Da da da da da da. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt knows that outputs is going to be a series of things. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's fantastic. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nReadme. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRequirements txt new file, I got submits and let's look at it. We got the config JSon file, bam. We have the, we'll get around to putting each one. Well would you know which ones those are open like key. Can you like code complete? No, why? Cody, I want you doom, doom doom. Okay, I guess not, but I don't need Cody right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo we'll get around to that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet's just copy paste this, which is the airtable utils we need to create an environment. Please create an environment, a virtual environment. Please help me create a virtual environment using. Is it puppeteer or poetry? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nTools. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nTools. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nPy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAgent templates. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBam. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nScrape LinkedIn profile which is part of LinkedIn scrape and that's that. And now we have the main py file. Yay. So all of these have their purpose. Their space is the IPO inb and we just need the readme. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nBecause it. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTried to do a readme, didn't it? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nTerminal. What is my shell configuration file? I see this after install. What is my shell configuration file? How can I find my shell configuration file? Mac m one e o e s. Nano cookie. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCookie. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHzczshrc and then I add a export. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd then I add. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThat didn't work. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSource. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBro. No way, I just use source correctly. Let's freaking go. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. Guide you through creating our. Well, can I skip because I know I have a worked, thanks. I have a requirements txt file. How can I give it to poetry instead of individually declaring each package after poetry? Oh, okay. It's just version 0.1. Author Kuba and Lejo. Three point ten. Yeah, three point ten. Find your main dependencies interactively. No no. Yes. Okay. Noise. So bam. What do you mean doesn't exist? Oh wait, there's no requirements file. Wait, why didn't you create the requirements file? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThere we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nDamn. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHow about now? How about. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNow? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHope I'll figure that one out later. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat is unnecessary. What I do need is the number one API keys. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo let me get these from this. Lang chain tracing. Lang chain API key config. Lang chain. Lang chain. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhat? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThink it's missing something? Some important stuff. At which point is it actually? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, so what we'll have to do. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIs say hey, therp API face ID. Face ID. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nTable name emails. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIcebreakers. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, it has been a while. What have you, what have you been up to? Sleep. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, fair enough. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. You've been taking some trips. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh nice. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we've been bouncing around quite a bit as well. We're in Australia now and be heading to Bali in the next. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWeek. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTo two weeks. Yeah, that's where we're relocating to base up. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSuper excited. Yeah, we both really love it there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd it'll give us a longer Runway to get things going with faster eyes and. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, let's see. The update is we have our first client. Super exciting. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's actually my cousin who is in. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe real estate industry. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nShe's a mortgage loan officer and when. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe were in Maryland. So my cousin and my aunt both. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWork in the mortgage space, and they invited us to this workshop on AI. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd chat with their AI guru. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd, yeah, we met a bunch of. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPeople, and we ended up talking to the speaker for a little while. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHe was so excited, and he's like, oh, my gosh. Well, you all are doing the thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm just here talking about all these tools and everything, but you guys are doing it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou all should come up and speak. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo on the fly, we got up. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd talked a little bit at this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPresentation, and it went really well, I think. We vibed with a lot of people. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we had a couple of one one meetings with my cousin and. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMy aunt, and we sat down with my cousin. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nShe's like, okay, this is the year. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOf getting all of my systems done. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I want this set up. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's my goal for the year. She came to the table with tons. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOf ideas and tons of things that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShe wants to automate. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we're starting with the sort of client relationship management part of her business. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNot even getting into the mortgage just yet. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut it's been interesting learning a. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLot about just that in the real estate industry and what she does and film time, so much of it is relationship. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd from what she was saying, she's. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLike, I don't need to be doing. The only thing I need to be doing right now is talking to realtors and talking to people that want to buy homes. All of this admin stuff I want off my plate kind of thing. And she knows a lot of people. So we're doing the first couple automations. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFor her for free, and then she. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHas a whole list of things. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo there will be some paid work. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAs well, and then it'll be a copy paste for a lot of the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPeople that she works with. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo that's where a lot of our attention is focused right now. But it's super exciting. And, yeah, the first automation we're building is a text to Google calendar integration. So she gets a text from someone that's, you know, this person, can you send over the pre approval letter for so and so? And it generates a task in her CRM, and then it will populate a calendar task on her Google calendar, and. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt'Ll do the same thing for event. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRequests that come through her text. And then we're building out some other automations within her CRM, which she uses a CRM called follow up off she loves. I'm not sure if you've heard of that one, but it's specific to the real estate niche. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd one of the things that she does, her, and so she and her. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt'S actually her best friend from childhood. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWho is a realtor. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThey're both like number one realtor mortgage folks in the state of Maryland. And a lot of what they do. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFor client appreciation and loyalty is they'll. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSend out gift baskets or handwritten notes during certain phases of their clients within the CRM. Kind of like a lot of CRMs, you can do this, you can build out your own automations. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd in follow up, boss, the automations. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAre called action plans. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo she's working on getting all of her action plans set up, and then we'll go in. And when a certain, like for a. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRealtor, for example, every quarter, she wants. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo send all of the realtors in her CRM a gift basket. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShe's already working with outside companies that put gift baskets together and send them. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOut or make handwritten notes and send them out. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo we will set up that external integration. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo Q one hits, end of Q. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOne hits, the automation triggers, and all of her realtor information gets sent over to the company that she's using for the gift baskets, and they go out and she doesn't have touch anything. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo similar process for. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that's what we've been focusing. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nA lot of energy on, as well. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAs building out a knowledge based system. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhich we're starting with fasterize. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo starting with all of the meeting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRecordings and getting the transcriptions from those to build a knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we can create a system where. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnytime we need information, we can ask it and it'll provide it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd the idea is it's evolving. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut if we're implementing this for another. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCompany, it's designed with certain Personas to. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGive information tailored to what, let's say a salesperson might need versus a CEO. So the Persona will deliver to that person the role specific insights that they. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNeed for whatever they might be doing. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nExactly. Like building it out and seeing what we need it for as insight for what other companies can use it for and then going from there. But I think once we get these first couple of automations done for this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nClient, then we'll start moving into replicating. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThese automations and getting into her referrals. She's got tons of referrals. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGoing into the real estate agents. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhich she was telling us that some. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOf the loan officers and some of the realtors that she worked with don't even use CRMs. They're still managing things on Excel. And when we met with her, she. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWas like, there is real data that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCorrelates realtors and loan officers who use CRMs make more money. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt's like, well, that's a brainer. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut just to hear the data come. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFrom her was interesting. Yeah, she's aware of it, and there's a lot of win because if the people she's working with have streamlined systems, then everyone makes more together, especially. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWith how closely tied real estate agents. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHave to work with mortgage loan officers. And at least in the US and. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIn this state, you're usually affiliated with an agency, but otherwise you're a freelancer. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd you're going out and you're getting your own leads. So another project we're working on is. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAn automated outreach system that is able. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTo scrape LinkedIn profiles and then generate. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUnique messages that speak to that specific person. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I think there's a few ideas we have floating around for how we can implement this for them. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBecause it wouldn't be LinkedIn, it would be Instagram. A lot of real estate agents and mortgage lenders are all on Instagram. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThey do a lot of self marketing there. And that'll be one thing we work with her team on. She's already hired a woman to manage her social media, but there's some inefficiencies and a little bit of misalignment with the branding that she wants quality. So that'll play a part of this eventually. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat'S what's been going on in faster eyes as well as Bartex. I don't know if you ever got a chance to use prompt factory assistance. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBartex, it's great. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBartex made like several iterations on it since perfecting it and it's really awesome. So I've actually been working on making some use case videos for PFA and I'm working on just videos in general to get more marketing content. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOur marketing is kind of fizzled in the moment, but the priority has been. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe client and outreach. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that's where we're at. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think there's been some phases. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhere the discord has been a little less active. I think we're getting back, finally getting back into our rhythm after the holidays and whatnot. So. Yeah, we've got. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I think that's the idea. And I'll have to get more updates. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFrom exactly where the dev team is with it. But yeah, it's a huge project that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen we can also use for our own outreach campaigns. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo it's been very exciting. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Please share. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFair enough. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, that's a good awareness that you've. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCome to about yourself and what you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nActually want to be doing. Because I've actually had a similar revelation of, like, I don't actually enjoy the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMaking posts and whatnot. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere's a part of this that I'm. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDoing because things need to be done. And I'm very excited to turn over. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll of the digital marketing to smma specific folks that are psyched about it. And I'm focusing on, what I really. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWant to focus on is the education and the training and the human development within faster eyes, and also how we're sharing value and knowledge with the community. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAround using tools and AI and how. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPeople can use this to benefit their own lives. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think it's in alignment with video. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nContent that we need to create for marketing anyways, so I'm finding some parallel lines with it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, aside from crypto, are there any. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOther parts of AI or this world that you're interested in learning more about? Like, are you interested in development, or are you exploring where you want to kind of apply your strength? Okay. Yes. Mmm. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, damn. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOkay. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think that's a good place to start. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nJust kind of getting back in the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLoop and even chatting with people one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOn one, you have time might help. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFind some ideas or find a place. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhere you feel like you might fit. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd if you're interested in crypto and forex trading, I would recommend reaching out to Alejo because he's just turning around and looking at me as I'm saying this, but he's done a lot of that. Was it forex you were teaching classes on? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, he's okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nHe actually started in a different life. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSeven, eight years ago on teaching people in Latin America about forex trading. So, yeah, he's like, in a different life. He was doing that. And very much the strategies that he's running for investment right now is largely centered on crypto. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo, yeah, you should chat with him about. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNot the forex trading so much anymore, really. It's crypto. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's less hands on with day trading. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMore to, like, long term crypto strategy. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIs where he's at right now. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHe'S been planning for this moment since 2020. Hold on, I'm going to take you out of my headphones. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWhat's up, dude? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's a funny picture. Hopefully no showing to him. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, I'm on discord. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCan you hear it? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHey, man. There we go. How are you doing? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nGood. I'm glad you're on the crypto train. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, one of my friends has been on this stuff for years as well. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nTrying to get all the cash going. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nA bit late to it, so I. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nJust trying to get as much money together right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nHave you invested anything at all? Have you invested anything at all? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, I buy a lot of coins and stuff. Enough capital to go through the bitcoin. So I've been enjoying these communities and stuff. This guy called Dr. Profit who just does all these signals of that. And so far I've liked two x already. Every coin I've got into. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCool. That's really good to hear. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWaiting for the actual. Was it like the super cycle to start? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, exactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWell, I'm glad you're learning about super cycles. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nKeep your money in, my man. Keep your money in for now. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nKeep your money in for now until. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt'S time to take it out. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah, take it out before it all drops. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou're doing any forex? \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWell, I was thinking about starting to learn Forex. I haven't actually started yet. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nReally? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI just kind of wanted to learn the skill and make money as I seen it. Forex is one of the easiest ways. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI can just do it. Just down to me. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. You know what, the thing about Forex. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIs that it's very marketable because the. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCharts, because the big numbers and there's this thing that people always show you, which is the actual losses. As big as you can make, you can lose. And I was there when this whole forex hype started in 2017, 2018. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo wait, earlier, 2015, 2016. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI don't know if imarkets live or wealth generators. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRing a bell? Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nGood. Stick with crypto, bro. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nStick with crypto. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nForex looks like a lot of fun. It's not as fun and not as profitable as crypto. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWould you say just learn how to trade crypto instead? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI would say figure out. Learn how to quote unquote trade crypto. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIn the medium term. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nDon't do like I get in the morning and I get out at night. Don't do like twelve hour strategy. Definitely not like minute to minute trading. Find dips that are obvious. Set up limit orders. Like, hey, if tomorrow, Ethereum, that's a 4000 today, or in the next week drops below 3500. Yeah, have a buy order there. That's always a good idea. But I'm going to buy at 4K, I'm going to sell at four one, and then I'm going to buy again at 450 until it goes to 4300. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou're going to end up sometimes losing money, but the stress that you're going. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTo go through is just not going to be worth. So take the route of learning crypto, meaning how does the market move? Who are the whales? How do you identify when a whale is moving its money? How do you read indicators of supply and demand? And all those things are very useful. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nYeah. Is there anywhere I should go to start learning about this properly, or is this just something I can have to. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's a great question. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'll find you something. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI appreciate that. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. It's a great interest to have, especially when the super cycle starts. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nMarkets. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt would be crazy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. It's about to get nuts. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd just so you know, strategy I'm taking is a time based strategy, not a price based strategy. So I'm taking from the halfing, which is happening in a month. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nA month? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's crazy. I've been waiting for this for four years, man. Three years. The halfing starts in a month. And from there, I'm doing a time span of four to six months. So in August, I start taking my money out. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAt whatever price it is, I start taking my money out. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd in October, I finish taking my money out. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I know I get a big rally. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI might not be the most profitable investor on earth, but I know, well, I'm already 100% up. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWe're already 100% up, and we've seen the cycle happen and we know it doesn't last forever. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd we also know that if you try to time it, this is going. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nTo be the peak of the price, 99% of the times, you're going to be wrong. So take the profits when they're in. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYour hand and you're happy with them. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd set a strategy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThey're not more about having a goal and having an endpoint in mind. It's just taking profits when you're there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nTrying to get the best. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWell, that's the hardest part, actually taking the profit. It sounds dumb, but it's like you hit your goal and every bone in your body will tell you to stay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIn the market and you have to. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLook at the piece of paper where you committed to, this is the number or this is the time, and actually. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nClick the sell button. It's the hardest part. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nWell, this is my first real cycle. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. Gnarly. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nAfter the first cycle, everyone loses out. I'm going to try and be that person. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, it's doable. It's hard. Most of us lose money on our first time around. For me in forex, I actually lost $2,000 in five weeks. Yes, because somebody had signals and the signals worked and I followed. And that just happened to be the month that it was a bad month, but somehow the next month was also a bad month. Yeah. It's hard to trust in that market because it's easy to show the earnings. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut nobody will show you what the reality is. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo I'm happy to help with some resources and what I can for proper education. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI'd really appreciate that because I am quite interested in this. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nGood job. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nKeep learning. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd it's a great market to get a job in. Dude, there's so many jobs around crypto, not only programming, not only trading. There's such a big thing that after you graduate uni and whatever, it's a great place to find a job too. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSo there are companies within crypto called their dows. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nDecentralized autonomous organization. And those require a lot of smart people that understand the inner workings that might not be actively trading the coins, that might not be programming the networks, but that can, for example, find out a need in the market of the, say, economics finances market. And that's how XRP got created. Hey, banks have a really hard time trading with each other internationally. Corporations have a very hard time. It's very expensive. So they created XRP with that use case in mind. And those weren't traders. Well, not necessarily were traders and not necessarily were programmers. They just found needs. And from there to managing a community, you can get paid for managing communities on discord. And these communities get very large. There's all kinds of jobs beyond programming and trading within the space. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I know. I didn't until a few years ago, and my cousin has actually been working for a company for a really long time and they have hundreds of employees. Yeah, okay, interesting. I'm excited for you, man. Yeah, I got to go back to programming some cool shit. That personalized outreach system, that page. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nThat sounded pretty cool. What's happening? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nFast price. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI'm going to try to get a live everyone again, kind of join. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nThe community again just to see what's. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nHappening and see if there is anywhere. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI can start helping out. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nJust looking around, just liking things. Even like joining a meeting every once in a while. It's appreciated because it's about the community. So if you want to be part of the community, there's always open arms. And thank you for letting me know because we're about to sort of purge the discord of a lot of people that have been inactive and you're showing interest. It's like well, I'll leave you in because you want to be in. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nReese shared he has a moment of. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRealization that it's like marketing. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSounds cool, but I don't actually enjoy doing it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd, I mean, that's an awareness. Things we learn of learning what we don't want to do can be just as important and insightful as what finding the passion and what we really want to be spending our time doing. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, totally. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nIt's good hearing you, man. Good luck with everything. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, it's been a while. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI'll be here more. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, we'd love to see you around. We're posting the schedule of events in the scheduling channel. We've got a couple of workshops coming. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUp, and I don't think we have. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nA gen exact meeting on the calendar for this week, but we'll definitely be having some soon because we have some important stuff to talk about. So. Yeah, just keep in the loop and let's stay connected and see what happens next. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGood chatting with you, Reese. And best of luck with your new adventures in crypto and wherever that may lead you. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll right, sounds good. Talk to you later. Bye. Sorry, honey. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI know you were in the middle of recording. Yeah, that's funny. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOh, no. Yeah, it was funny. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's funny. I know someone who is very stupid. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's cool. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLula. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNasanandamo. The time they look at Wendy oil. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's strange. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo eight create agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIt. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd why wouldn't this qualifier prompt message placeholders line 32 message placeholders.

I needed to DS code now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I moved it to vs code. Now I'm dealing with arrange my code. Can I share my screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I checked that video. I think the idea is great, but I have to check it in action. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I found a way to view, like I can view the prototype in anaconda environment. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI found a way to build the prototype for testing in visual studio code with an Akonda. Then I can arrange the code, structure it in a way that you can understand, like breaking it into chunks. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat'S where I am right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, so right now this is my prompt. I created a py file for all my prompts. Then this is going to be like all the functions. First of all, the first function I'm going to do is load a file. Then the second one is to split the file into trunks. Then the third function is to create an embedding with OpenAI. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's either I think two or so. That's it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I'm still figuring it out. So I can push it to the GitHub if. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, let's do it. If you could just push it to a dev branch and so we can actually keep track of everybody's branches. Whenever we have something that's working, we'll push it to main. For now, let's keep it in a dev branch. Cuba branch. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nA follow up, boss. I've been working on the API. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I got two big wins today. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's all integrated into one uni box. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDoing through the API. And that's actually what I did through the API. Going back to the actual code. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo with that context, what we have. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThem by the last sent text because. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat way around this we can find and if we can't find a way around it, then we'll just implement something different. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut to get the money in, we'll need to have this productionized in a way that everything is getting triggered in an automatic way. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCustom function to assistant. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's one we also need to do. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCustom function to assistant. We need to do trigger chat when text message gets received. We also need to do unblock privacy mask. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nPrompt. Versioning is very helpful. And this is actually hard lesson learned, because in the first project of celebrities, we didn't do that. You know, what was the error that was coming from not doing this, not prop versioning? It was that I had at some point outputs that were good enough. We just wanted to make them little more perfect for the client because he still had some things to say about this. And then next iteration was worse, and I couldn't go back because I didn't have the prompts from before.Speaker 2\\nThat's unfortunate. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou learn on your mistakes, and I will remember this for the rest of my life. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMy God, that sucks. But thank you for bringing that lesson in. There are some things to change, because. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt was actually claude that grabbed these. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n600 lines of code. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, not that one. Yeah, this one. And made it into. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt took a while. It took a lot of like, forcing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHim to do stuff, but it worked like charmish. It worked like 80%. Details, details. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe flow is pretty much the same. There's some stuff to change. I'm getting some errors. And this Kuba, I will rely on. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou because it's errors like where are. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, prompts missing required variables, tool names. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTools and agent scratchpad. But I see these getting called. Right? Where is it? The tools, message placeholders. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I don't know if that is. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThose tools, but that kind of stuff, I'm going to need to rely on you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo let's get together tomorrow and we can walk through this whole repo together. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is Claude's interpretation, right. So we can modify whatever we want. And I'll just do some tweaks, like getting the right LinkedIn scraper in and whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo that's where we're at. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd we'll get us up and running. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAs soon as possible. Awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBartech, we said were going to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nStart keeping track of in a more like, organized manner. So let me pull up the to do list. We can look at it together. We have this notion very soon we will give access to everybody, so we. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCan keep track of everything together. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd I'm going to go filter by dev. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd we have all the dev projects. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHere, so knowledge now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBartech, how are the agents doing? Did you get a chance to start. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDrafting any of these prompts? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nActually, I was about to do it today. Cool. I still haven't had time just to start this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, yeah, it's morning for you guys. That's right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. But I think we still need to have the structure of the lank chain. So it's still going to be probably a few days right before we can even start using those prompts. That's why I wasn't so much in a hurry yesterday to have it by the morning. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTotally. I hear what you're saying. We are going to the MVP is definitely going to use blank chain and we want certain tools. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut in reality, as we looked at this MVP, most of this list is just text based rather than tool based. So let's walk through it together one more time. I have a prompt. We have the global context, which is going to be like, hey, this is fasterized. This is the dev team, this is the marketing team, et cetera, like a two pager. And we're going to enrich context from that document. So is there a vector database connected at this point where. With Langchain for sure, but it doesn't need Langchain to start testing that prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's just kind of PFA. So I'm working on this global context document. We will need a draft for the agent and then we'll go the next step. As obviously Kuba just showed, he's working on the pine cone integration on the chat and we'll keep integrating one agent after the other. But there is a relative urgency on getting drafts for each of these agents so we can test them. So we can start testing them. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, I should have the contact before end of this meeting. The contact prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSounds good. Sounds good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAwesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI am super curious about repo on my account or on the faster? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's keep it on the faster so we can all contribute and Kuba can put his. I don't know if you joined the meeting by when we said it, but yeah, he's going to keep a branch of his code that is kind of his branch, and keep your branch of the code in the same repo but your branch. So let me go do that and let me just create a new repo right now, unless we have one already. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's see. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, I'm going to create one now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe keep debating whether there's a space or not in between knowledge and now the hard technical problems. There's also a conversation of building in public, which we've been trying to hone in on. And we're going to keep this public for now as alignment of who vasterize is, which we want to keep doing transparency and we want to keep sharing this happy to open because the prompts. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nIn there going to be also partly PFI prompts. Maybe we have a separate repo for the prompts alone. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo separate repo. Let's keep it all in one. In that case, let's do then I'm going to keep it closed for now. And whenever we find a way to protect what we need to protect while still giving people access to leveraging the amazing things that we're doing. Also, how we find other great devs is by sharing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo let me now figure out how. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo change. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nKnow. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nLike, for example, the first version of PFA. I'm happy to share the prompts to the public, but the latest version I would rather keep in our private space. And the context prompt will be basically repurposed from the PFA. Context prompt will have around 10% difference. So that will be publishing PFA latest advancements. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI know that you have taken that approach with PFA, and I want to respect how you want to do it on that end, and we'll figure out how that philosophy fits with the rest of the project, because. Yeah, you have a good point. We don't necessarily need to be sharing the latest prompts. The system, even as a whole, works very well, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAt least in theory. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo even with mediocre prompts, we could get good output. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhy is this not working? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAnd also, I think in terms of knowledge now being our flagship product. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nNot sure if we should just give it away like that. I mean, I get your point. I get your point, but still, we want to make money on this, and do we want somebody else to be making money on this without us knowing? That's something to consider, definitely. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOne of the questions, is the market big enough? How much is stable diffusion? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFully. Mmm. I wonder how much. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThey're at $44 million with pretty much everything open source. And then they have, obviously, the specialization for enterprise. One is not exclusive from the other. This is somebody. This is a company that is doing what we want to do in a different approach. Probably better that we can do it right now, and they're doing well. Most likely. The market is so big that it matters so much less who's better and who's first, and it matters a lot more who can find the customers. So let's continue talking about this. I think that these are all constructive conversations. I just made the repo private, and we can figure out how we can help bring this amazing technology to people and also gain income from enterprises. Thank you for bringing up these conversations, Bartek. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI just have one question. That this rewind thing you showed they are open source? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, they're closed. Yeah. I don't know. They don't have a GitHub. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWas an example of a company that's doing something similar, and they're taking the closed source approach. I do believe that having a thousand stars on GitHub will beat good marketing every single time, because with the engineers that attracts and the sort of industry acknowledgement, oh, how did stable diffusion even come to get famous? It was through the engineers, not through the marketing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut it's interesting. We can debate about this for years. I'm going to pause here. I just want to make sure that everybody can see this. I just want to make sure that if everybody goes to the GitHub, the fasterized GitHub, and everybody would have access to create a pull request or create their own branch. I'm going to post the link, and. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou guys me know. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPermissions, and. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI think I'm gonna also delete this fast drive. Okay, never mind. Yeah, there we go. Side project. There you go. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNow that's not going to be annoying. And we can rename our GitHub actually faster. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nICE. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCuba, you're in here. We have limited. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, but I can get enterprise. I have enterprise. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, I'll figure that out on my end. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRange. I thought I had on organization. Okay, I'll figure this out later. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nEverybody has access. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nOr no, I have the error 404. The page is not existent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's because the repo is private. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYou have to send me invitation to the email. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, the problem is that we have the four seats. Outside collaborators, maybe. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, let's do something. Let's change this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTo convert to outside collaborator. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOrganization from all teams. And if they don't have any private. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRepositories in the organization, their seed will be reclaimed. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGreat. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo now I invite a member, Bartech. How do I find you in, I. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nSend you in the chat, my name on the GitHub. Actually, I don't sure what the email I have in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Yay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo Kua, you're in there. I'm going to add you in here. Hoobie, too. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSorry for waiting. I have to change my password because my account is locked. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. Yeah, because the two fa, they changed that. You need two factor authentication. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI don't know if that's why invite somebody else. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, well, what did you call the name of that company? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry, would you get closer to the mic? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI said, what did you call the name of that company? Building something similar. The name of the company. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI didn't rewind. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nWe have the GitHub copilot. Copilot or I shouldn't request that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI am going to get us GitHub Copilot. I think I can, through the Microsoft founders hub, that might be able to give us GitHub Enterprise and GitHub Copilot, hopefully GitHub Copilot as. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nI request, because it's prompting me to request GitHub Copilot or not. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAs long as you don't sign up for anything, then yeah, do a request and maybe I can see some more information. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, add people, collaborators, and what's your email, hooby? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI sent you on the chat? 1 second. Okay, here you go. I have error 40 four and I'm login. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, 1 second. Can I add a collaborator? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, if we keep this private, then you won't be able to see it. Let's. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow do we do that? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm going to look into founders hub tomorrow, so let me add that as. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nA to do list. We can go from there. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGitHub Enterprise, because I think it's up to ten seats. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd copilot. Okay, cool. I'll check it out tomorrow. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's move on. Artek, you're going to be working on the prompts. Kuba. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I'm already doing that at the moment. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAwesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nKuba, you are working on the initial integration for Pine cone and for the initial queries where we can ask a prompt and pine cone will be queried. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, about it. Prompt config. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry, say it again. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhere we can prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDid I get you the resources? Did you check out the resources? You're asking about prompt engineering? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat I'm saying is in the initial, I showed you an initial code where I'm just like querying it without no prompt at all. Right. Now I've added a prompt templates to the code where we can write our prompts. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat is it that you would like? An initial system prompt for the LLM. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOr. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet me share my screen. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, sorry, sometimes I have trouble hearing with your mic. Well, it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYesterday was without prompt. We are just praying this where we can direct. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is it before. Now we're just giving it like context and our tooling, but now we can give it more instructions, like using this template, like creating like a system prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. So this is, I'm missing exactly what it is that you're asking that let's have a system prompt for this portion. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, what I'm saying is, you said you're talking about the initial integration. I'm talking about what I've added to the initial integration. Like I've added a constant. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry, dude, it's the mic. I hear static. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe version I demoed without this prompt templates. What I'm saying now is I've added this prompt templates, we can add the system prompt. This context is just like the embeddings from vector database. Then we can query. We can add our question. This is just like the user query. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nTo get our. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, great. Could we try running it right now? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWell, scripting the baby different. I can put my phone here. What do you want to ask? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI forgot what this means. Oh, yeah. Explain the real estate automation. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nRight. Guys, do we need to talk about something more? Because maybe you should focus on the prompts, like sitting quiet and then just do my thing with the prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, one thing more. So if you can give me three minutes and I'll let you go. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, weird. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt keeps doing that. And that's the new key. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nO, T and C. Yep. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nStrange. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, Bartek, I guess my only question to you is you have clarity on the system, how it's working together? Yes. Bartek, let me send you the transcript of our call from yesterday. And if you're having trouble with giving clarity to PFA about which portions, how the rag query extractor is going to work, whatever, you can also leverage that. So I'll send you those documents if that's useful. And honestly, I've got. Let's. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, I think we got clarity, but that might be useful to give clarity to the PFA, though. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I agree. I'll send you the documents and if you can. Maybe it's taking pictures of the figma, maybe it's one big picture, something that would allow an LLM to give kind of a step by thorough, step by step of the details of the system, which is kind of what we want knowledge now to do. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll the works are there. We need to figure out how to get all that good information out. And Claude might be really good for that because for JGBT, a lot of things get lost in the middle. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. I also heard good stuff about cloud, though. I don't have access personally to this, though. Pavel have access on his perplexity. But that's private perplexity, not a company one. So we had to. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI will figure that out then I will make sure that you have access to Claude. Maybe it's a fasterized account. We'll figure it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe? \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah, let's get to the company account. We also thinking about it between me and Pavel and the celebrities, but yeah, we are kind of tough on the money right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, honestly. Same here. We're deep in the negative, but we're doing anything to make this work. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHey, guys. Hey, Henry. Hey. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI thought I'd hop in. No worries. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCuba is in the middle of a live demo. And as any live demo, it breaks when you don't want it to break, but it's all good. It's all love. Kuma, are you passing the API key when you're initializing the OpenAI client? I think that might be one of the things, but anyway, Henry, how are you doing, man? Tell us a little bit about your trip. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI'm doing good. I'm in Thailand with my dad, so I'm struggling to find time to work, but I miss it, to be honest. And Thailand's great. I've been scuba diving. Yeah, really good. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's good to have you here and see your face, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nAnd when I said travel bug, I didn't mean I'm ill. I meant I just want to travel more. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHenry didn't actually get a stomach virus. He just meant he wanted to travel more. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe were so. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLike, Southeast Asia is notorious for that. So we're at the tail end of the meeting. Bartek was just about to jump off. He's working on some prompts for knowledge now. I want to walk hooby a little bit through the system. So while you're here, man, if you can stop sharing screen and let's definitely meet up tomorrow and we'll work on the personalized outreach. We'll work on this pine cone thing, and we'll get things running. Thanks for the progress, brother. \\n\\nSpeaker 5\\nAll right, already, the repo, I made some folders, two initial commits. So I'm just going to bounce off and have my focus time on the prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPerfect. Awesome. Stay there, Steve. Artek. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo were thinking for. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nA use case for an MVP. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDid you get to see the video. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHenry, that five minute. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nNo, I haven't got around to. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool, cool. No worries. I get more chances to explain this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd become more eloquent at explaining it. So knowledge now access all your data, all your knowledge of every source in an accessible, real time way. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd one of the use cases that were thinking for ourselves is being able to message the bot to catch up on meetings, to get clarity on assignments, to brainstorm together, all that usual stuff. This component messages the bot to catch. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUp on meetings and get clarity, is. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGoing to be part of a bigger. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nComponent, a bigger V one, which is about everybody having clarity, everybody being able. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTo essentially a project manager assistant or. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nA scrum master assistant that can help each of us and all of us as a team, be as productive, as efficient, as creative as possible as we're working on stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo when you ask this, you know, I missed half of this meeting. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBartek now has to leave, and he. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWants to catch up on what happened. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOn the rest of the meeting. So he messages knowledge now and we're. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGoing to go backwards with the system. What happens on the second to last. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nStep before the answer. So when the LLM chat GBT, whoever actually creates the answer, we want to evaluate the answer. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHow close is this to a full, accurate, relevant answer? Because it has access to all the transcripts, it has access to every project. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat we're actually trying to do at faster ICE where our clients are, so. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt can assess, evaluate how good the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnswer is before it actually sends it back. So to evaluate the answer, we need answer. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's answer agent, and this is obviously a multi agent system. When Bartek is saying that he needs to go work on the prompts, is the prompts for each of these agents. This answer for what we're going to work on what my tasks are, and hey, let's brainstorm on how we're going. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo work on them together. Needs some format and in this MVP. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe'Re going to kind of ignore that because we know what the format is. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt'S a to do list. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe tasks are assigned to this person because I am Alejo, these are my. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTasks, and we keep going backwards, but I'm going to pause here because all that information we extract through rag and. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nKuba, what he's working on right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIs activating the pine cone, uploading these. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDocuments and then creating efficient querying of the vector database. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we're going to have this big component here. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis big component here is essentially saying. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHey, what are the relevant chunks from. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe vector database in our meetings? To answer the question in this case the to DOS, what are the to DOS? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCould you give me clarity on how. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThese to DOS work with the whole project? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, we query the vector database, we. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nEvaluate how good those chunks that were retrieved actually are. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBecause querying vector databases sometimes tricky. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe need to evaluate that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhen we say real estate agent, the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSystem doesn't confuse real estate agent with an AI agent, which is what we're. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBuilding for knowledge now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo evaluate how good are the outputs. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFrom the vector database. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's for testing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe're going to glance over the supervisor. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo we're going to now merge all that relevant data from the vector database, all that enhanced context, we're going to merge it. Merge it into what? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, merge it into the answer formatting agent. So the answer agent can actually answer the query. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIn order to know what exactly we're asking the vector database, which again is. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSometimes tough to have the right queries in the right way. For the vector database, we need to have a rag extractor agent which will. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBreak down an initial prompt, in this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCase the to DOS, into multiple queries that are optimized for rAd. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo some queries that might be optimized or might be derived from a to do list for you, Henry, would be. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, what is the project about? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWould be one query for the vector database. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat is knowledge now about? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nA second useful query for the vector database might be what has already been. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDone and what is left to do. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnother good query is what is each person's assignments? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll of those questions will feed into this evaluator agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll those chunks, all those answers to each of those questions. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNow we have a bunch of chunks. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd we just say these are useful. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThese are not useful. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd before we can ask the vector. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDatabase. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBefore we can ask the vector. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDatabase the right questions, we need to. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nMake sure that the prompt that the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInitial prompt that this hey, give me a to do list is actually enriched. So now we get to the very. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFrom the back we got to the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nVery start, which is you ask what are my to do lists for this next step of the project that will get enriched with global context about who faster ICE is, who each team is, what projects we're working on. PFA will enrich the prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe'll derive different rag optimized queries. We'll prompt the knowledge base several will prompt the vector database several times. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe're going to glance over those ones, we're going to merge all those answers. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFrom the vector database into the most. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUseful ones into one full answer that then we're going to format and then we're going to deliver the answer to you through for now, a discord chat box. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo now you have, these are your. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo dos, Henry, and this is the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nContext of the project. This is how it's relevant to the project. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd that's going to be our MVP. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, I can explain that ten times better, but it's a big complicated system. \\n\\nSpeaker 6\\nI kind of get the gist of it, but I'm also shattered. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI've been up for I bet you cool hoobi, what clarity can we provide on how these components are working or what the objectives are? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I think I understand it pretty clear, but I have some troubles with figuring out how to integrate it with each steps. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, definitely. That's part of the complicated stuff. I think we all have questions about that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI think connecting it with make could be difficult. So I think. No, no idea yet, sorry. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, no worries. It's all questions here, all questions that we're being curious about and navigating to potential answers. Have you played around with PFA much? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, but you mean the newest PFA? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, I'm just PFA in general. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI'm working with Bartek since October, so I have tried every version of PFA which was released except the newest one. I think last version was good enough for me. I'm going to try the new one, but let's see if it is good enough for me. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBut yes, we work with many versions of PFA. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. That's great. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's a great place to start. So you're kind of already ahead. I just sent you an invitation to this figma board and the challenge for you for tomorrow. Now we have to leave because we have the outreach meeting. We're starting an email campaign for real estate tomorrow, so I have to leave. But the challenge for you, Hoobie, is going to be to, in one sentence, say we're building knowledge now, and express what it is in your own words, in simple words. And then you're literally going to copy paste each of these boxes one by one into chajibtin, into the PFA GPT. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou're going to just copy paste one by one and you're going to have a conversation with it, see what it comes up with so it can give you clarity of what it thinks this whole system is, which I would hypothesize that it would do a pretty good job at. It might fail. It might be like complete gibberish, because these are just words that we put together in these little stickers, so might not be clear enough, but I'm all about tangible and practical, so let's start that way. You're familiar with PFA. You're not very familiar with this system, so let's create a bridge from what you know to what you don't know yet. Is the assignment clear? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAnd you want me to make PFA explain what knowledge now is? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nThat's all? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. Let's start there. Message me when that's done and I'll have another challenge for you. For now, I think we might all be surprised as to how well PFA captures it. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, sounds pretty clear. Understood. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe're going to level that up. There's going to be some questions for rag. There's going to be some questions about what a good prompt for each agent might be, how agents will communicate with each other. So we're going to level it up. That's not like the full assignment, right. But for now, that's your challenge. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay sounds good. But you said you sent me an invitation for that board. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI can see that on my email. You're sure you didn't Ubi that's correct. That's correct. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen I am sending you the link on discord Kuba. When you get that API issue fixed let me know if it doesn't get fixed. But when you get that fixed could you connect with Hubi and walk him through from the start walk him through that initial rag because Hubi's also trying to get better at rag and I'm sure he'll have some questions and we all want to get better at explaining things and we all want to get better at understanding things so if you guys can connect at some point today that would be wonderful. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, cool. Ubi, what number are you going to be today? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nSorry Ubi, it yeah I hear you. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI can be feel like 08:00 p.m. GmC today. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-13 Dev Meeting - KnowledgeNow Assignmentscleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nThis was a bit of an exercise to gauge where you're standing and how you're feeling with this specific challenge. Prompting is something that we all need to be very comfortable with. So this is good to know. As we standardize how we evaluate competencies, Powell actually worked on a competency matrix. It's going to be very good for us to know how we want, each of us, what skills do we want to have six months from now, but also which skills do we need to work on over the next six months? And some of us also need to keep working on prompting.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTell me a little more about where you are, where you feel you are skill wise. Maybe you've built some sort of project on Python and is Python what you want to focus on or is it something else?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMy python is. I think it's good enough. I surely know basic, which is enough for me. Rest I can do with GTP Python. I know enough to handle that language. From the python side, I think it's okay. But I have to dive into specially that language things. How to build that every step by step. Line by line? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Okay, then let's step it up. A few questions. Did you and Cuba get a chance to connect over this last day? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLast day was Internet connections problem, but we scheduled this for today. 08:00 p.m.. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. So, Kubi, you're going to build on your end what Kuba is building on his end? There is something. And were just with Bartek and Powell talking about building systems that are resilient, that a year from now are working at the same quality, even better than they're working today. And that's very hard, especially with AI, especially as models change, especially as industry standards change. So we actually have in parallel been working on three different MVPs now, four different MVPs for knowledge now because we're taking different routes.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEach MVP, each at least attempt at an MVP is showing us very different things about what the final thing is going to be. That being said, when you connect with Kuba, he's going to show you the code. You obviously have seen the logic in the Figma and we're going to build the first few steps, being able to upload the documents to a pine cone database and being able to query the documents. So the challenge is going to be is number one and I'm going to write this down. Number one, not copy the code. Number two, querying pine cone. Number three, creating some tests of how you would define a successful retrieval. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTest or I was just adding here whenever you have to think of something creatively and you kind of don't have idea, it's not like you need to do it all by yourself. Trying to do here I think is like don't copy the code from Cuba but write your own code. But you can ask chat, GPT for example, what test I should write, what I should test even. There you go, how the query should look, right? You can at least use AI for assistance.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm actually referring to knowledge now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWritten for that Cuba. Starting writing the first part, right, the uploaded document to pine cone and then query the database. The queries are going to change with the PFA rag extractor agent, right? So the queries are going to become automated. But it's been made clear that Rag is what every single person that is in AI needs to get specialized in, needs to get better at from wherever you are better and I have two resources I'm going to share with all of us, that we're all going to read. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor example, I don't know how much this code is, maybe it's just a portion. So there could be two ways of looking at this from Hubert perspective. So one thing I imagine if you, Hubert, have some kind of blockade to write the code. I don't know if you already throw the outreach system cells into PFA for explanation, but what you could do is maybe you start from what Kuba has already written and put that the knowledge base system I refer to now and put that into PFA, explain line by line, but then start to make it from scratch and not look at the lines of code. Just try to read the whole reasoning for this cell that PFA gave you and then close this window and try to write the code yourself. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's what's going to become valuable. Thank you, Bartek. That is such a good point. It's the systems design thinking that is going to be the most valuable thing once AI can write all our code. Even with PSA, right. If you don't have the objective clearly in mind and an idea of how to get there, how will you know when it deviated from the objective? So, great suggestion. Do it with PFA. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nMy update is I fixed the API issue yesterday and I wrote some fonts I could show you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat would be great, man. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLet's go.Speaker 1\\nHey, do we send it to the merge agent self refinement agent to knowing what to do next and making decisions on refining agents based on priority and the big picture? Okay. It's not wrong, but there were other branches. We talked about the merge agent and it didn't mention the merge agent, so. Cool. The QA agent is going to be really good for the V two vartech. The QA agent is going to be good for partly creating these tests for the rag and evaluating the output. What is another test? Sorry, Bartech, are you talking? We can't hear you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI was muted on my computer. Yeah, I think maybe we should have TDD agent kind of. Because you're referring to the tests on the project discussed, right. Or on the knowledge based system itself? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOn the knowledge based system on Monday when we designed the whole system and each agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I think we got evaluators and stuff. I think it's already there. Regarding the knowledge based system evaluator, will be the QA supervisor. We got three agents for that. No, I was thinking from the output perspective of the use case. Then if we discussing projects, maybe we can have test driven development agent that will develop the test cases before the programmer agents get to their job. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. So that would be the programming module of like the tester, the programmer. Yeah, and we'll definitely get around to that. I'm really excited. Have you guys seen Devon? What? It's the newest thing and they're calling it soft AGI because it's a software engineer that just runs man, autonomously and it just runs and it creates the whole thing in its own environment. It has its own web browser. I'm going to send you guys a video. It is something like what we're trying to create, but this one is specialized for software engineering. Kuba, did you see it by any chance? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nI saw. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's worth checking out. It is insane. And it will give you guys a very tangible idea of what this branch of programmers within knowledgenow would ideally be able to do. But we can discuss that more tomorrow. Where do we go from here? You have a little, nice little chat box. We can ask the queries. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThere is the contact agent. Sorry, do we have the context agent prompt? It's already in here, Kuba. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLet me check. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo if we can add in the context agent into this system, that would be a huge win. That would be a huge win. Let's see. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, here I am. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo Bartek, I'm having a hard time. Oh yeah, you shared in the GitHub. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay folder with the final version. It's live version or something like that. It's the folder because I make a little mess in this GitHub repo Bartech few working sessions. I mean working files. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Let's make sure we keep version controlling. Kuba, there's two tasks that you are assigned to, which is integrating the context agent. But the agent is going to need context. So we're going to take it one level up. The context is going to be the fasterized document about who we are and we need to refine it. It needs work for it to work correctly. But let's integrate the context agent, and let's have a way to very easily, at least friction as possible. There's a new document, there's a new text document. Say it's a transcript, and we can just upload it easily to pine cone. Is that a upload button on the chat box? Maybe. Let's come up with a way that we can upload documents to pine cone easily. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf I am underestimating the amount of work that would take, let me know as you're working on it. And that's not necessary. But remember how we talked about the components and the subcomponents? Reducing friction is one of those important subcomponents. So maybe in that chat box there's a button to upload a document and that gets directly uploaded to pine cone. And now we would have more context to query from. Thank you, Bartek, for sharing that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI dropped the link because it's on my branch, so maybe you couldn't see that in the first place. Okay, yeah. And this is the best version because I have few versions in there. I also got some working materials in there because I also have a few ideas where to go further with that. But I already spent like 3 hours on this prompt and I was like, okay, it's already good, man. It's already good. Stop doing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm glad that, I'm proud of you for stopping yourself. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWould I have like three working files where we could explore further? Different kind of different functions, different world. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, I see that. Cool. Let's keep it streamlined for now. And all of this is going to be incredible. Test data, each working file. It's going to be really good test data. Okay, let's go step by step because there's a lot of things to keep track of. System in it for knowledge. Now, AI agent context orchestrator. Right, I did see that. Lane. Space activation. Love that. Love that. We might want to, did you? Okay, yeah. Anyway, transcript analysis context enrichment context orchestrator latent space activation in multi agent system dynamic Persona for transcript analysis fix, extrapolate, upgrade data, enriching the AI slate in space and facilitating our best prompted engineering. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIn the Vs code. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, sorry. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt looks way more readable in the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMarkdown. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd you get those little highlights. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, that is cool about vs code. Just jumping through it though, wondering if you gave it some examples of latent activation. Just like the video that you shared. David Shapiro, latent space activation and that GitHub had. Actually, the examples had take a step. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBack, step by step. Yeah, he had this thing with the Romper or something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI didn't quite see how that conveyed to the use case. This latent space activation is kind of similar to what I use in PFA. I upgraded it a little even and expanded because I had some new ideas while I was going through this. So yeah, it should just try to be relevant because we don't know what user are going to write in. So to be as flexible as possible, I make those kind of variables in the prompt. Maybe I will share my screen. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I see what you're saying. Request enrichment, and then we can have some variability protocol, thrill and Persona dynamically. Yeah. Okay. Before you share screen, Kuba, what clarity do you need about the tasks that you have assigned? Cool. Let's keep communication open. If something comes up, if you hit a blocker, let us know. Awesome progress, Kuba. I love that you added a text box. That makes it everything so much more tangible. Awesome. Okay. Yes. All right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo as you can see, it looks a little different in here. It's way more readable. You actually see all those things that I highlighted by colors. So we're going for the user objective. So that's basically the input. And here this is the variables that are all relevant to what the user query is. And the goal is kind of like also highlighted. Yeah, I'm going to read this. All right. Now I just want to quickly show you guys what this is about. So this is basically like till here we got kind of briefing or in it, I don't say the full initialization. Yeah, I had a problem with speaking, but yeah, later we got steps. So those are the. Maybe some of you who use PFA are familiar with those mean, especially this one is from PFA. So those are the functions for enrichment. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I go crazy with them. And I laid out whole process basically like that. And yeah, this should provide a prompt for the next agent. I still got some ideas in. Wait, the work in progress. Yeah, I comment in here that this could be. Let's see if we can get self refinement function or tool to work with this one continuous improvement loop. So this will be like kind of. Now those all are the prompt functions as I call it. And we could connect it with real function and make a tool that would be connected with the agents also to be done. I marked this like maybe we later want to have some output format to be passed to another agent. I don't know, maybe some kind of JSon or whatever. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut I left it for like JSon would be interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo to just give you guys of my file structure. So this is like work in progress. So this will be like not finished prompt. Some ideas, some comments like in here and this is the work files. It's just ideas for different versions of things. Basically these are the steps. Version live is the one that this is for testing. Like live is for testing or after testing. Because I did some testing on GPTs. It was working fine. I'll show you guys in a second. And this is like some ready. I actually messed up a little in here because I make like this is ready and this is ready, right? So let's just agree that if there is prompts, live folder is those prompts that were accepted and those are kind of for testing, right? And this is like totally work in progress actually. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is like all work in progress. And the live, I think it's safer, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, it's great. So I just want to make sure we're on the same page. I'm going to share screen real quick. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI don't know how to stop the sharing because I hide the controls. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere you go. All right. You all can see my screen? Yeah? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYep. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. So, Bartech, we're going to have a prompt. We're going to have an initial prompt, just like what we asked for Cuba that know, what are the branches of the supervisor agent? And then along with the global context, which is just going to be a document, the PFA context enrichment agent is going to grab the prompt and the global context as a full document or rag query. The full document. Are we essentially copy pasting the full document into the prompt? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI don't think so. Maybe we could have like summary in the prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSummary, but a summary would lose a lot of information. We could try SPR as far as priming representation. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, but maybe let's try rag and we'll see how that goes. See if it works. And it works. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWouldn't that be too meta? Because now we're trying rag on a document and the prompt is going to be pretty much the same every time. So the rag is going to grab the same answers from the global context almost every time. Obviously the variation is the prompt. In that case, shouldn't we be like, hey, here's the global context. And it's like one page about Max. One page max about fasterized each team and each project. And it's like, hey, here's the context about the company that is asking, here's the prompt, enrich this prompt. And now we go into the rag sub queries. I think what makes sense to have global context and then not give it the context, right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShould have context for each team or each use case of the knowledge. Now, for example, there is dev project, there is dev context, something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFor HD. That is part of the idea, yes. And part of what we have to figure out for a v two is at which point, is there a gate? Is there gated access? Maybe it's here where the rag extractor agent would create or create optimized queries based on. Oh, this is a marketing question. So only access documents with the metadata marketing. So that would be the rag extraction, because then it would know what questions to create that would create the knowledge base. If we do it too early, then. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe'Re losing coming back to the context. Because as I tested on the GPT, I think we don't even need that much context. Because the example, when I see the chat where I tested it, and I say like, extract info from the project and it just did a quite good job, I believe. If you can maybe share that on the screen now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, let me try to find it one time, shared it on art chat. There we go. Did this one. Yeah. Step one, context gathering, enrichment request enrichment, semantic expansion. Great perspective enrichment. Lovely clarification query. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe final output is in the down. Like, you get the prompt that sent. This is all reasoning. And this is the actual prompt for. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou know what my issue is that giving the context as a meeting, prong, discussing a project, your task is to create that. It is very important that it knows fasterized. Who fasterizes? The teams that we have, the projects that we're working on. Otherwise, this is just generic. This would be good because PFA is amazing but limited. And when in the future we get to implement this for a client, we would need, essentially the description, the one pager of who they are. So global context. Nobody can debate the quality of the prompt that you made. Well, you can because you're a perfectionist, and I'm glad that you are, because we're building amazing things here. This is very high quality output. Team enrolls, list the key team members involved in the project. It should already know that. So let's put this one pager. We can start. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nVery simple. We can start with, essentially the real estate one that says, hey, here are the projects, and here is how they relate to real estate. Maybe we can start tweaking it in that direction. I still have to work on a one pager for fasterize of like, hey, here's every team. This is what we're working on. But we do have that for real estate, so let's use what we have. It's very narrow, so we won't get too confused. But if there are some failure states, it'll become obvious what those failure states are. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's try running this prompt into what we have now into what Kuba made in the button. You have button in that? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, that's right. How do you want to do it? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, just the thing that Kuba showed us. We can just put that in there in this chat. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Hopefully it doesn't break the context window of the chat. I'm posting this on the chat. Your message is too long. Okay, I'm sending you the link to the chat. Kuba. If you could ask that prompt. Ask a question into your chat box. I'm actually curious now. Good idea, Bartek. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause there is quite a metadata that could be coming from how to say the etiquettes, how to say in English. It's a different word. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe metadata that is coming from. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis is dev meeting. This is the meeting. That's what I was thinking about. I just had the polish version of the word in my head because the etiquette is something like that in English. Like etiquette. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's more of etiquette in English. Yeah. Means the right social of doing things. Social norms. Yeah, social etiquette. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor example, in Poland, this is the etiquette. How to say you want a product, have etiquette. All right, whatever. This is off top. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOften. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGoodbye with us. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. Let me share my screen, show you what I'm doing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nMy DSP. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSometimes I think generally I was thinking of myself always like a good English. But the more I get into some more complex stuff, I'm thinking I should maybe go for some english lessons. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHonestly, this is great english lessons because you're forced to do English. And perfecting English is also about talking in English with english speakers. So you're coming to Bali. So that'll be a great opportunity to speak with a lot of english speakers. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Actually, I already spoke with pace today that it's probably going to be postponed a few months because it'll be in Europe rather. So save some money and then later, after some projects start rolling and the money flows in. Definitely. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's ironic because for me, going to Bali is cheap and going to Europe is expensive. We can see your vs. Code right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. Just my, just my vs. Code. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLet's try it again. I've kept the prompt. So what do you want to up to? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, so that link to the chat GBT conversation that we put in the chat has a prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYou mean this one? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat should be it. Could you copy it and mark down? \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay, are we prompting it or why is it as a prompt template? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSay that one more time. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAre we prompting it like prompts that testing with? Are we using agent or want to input it? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo the last link we shared in the chat has the whole conversation with this context orchestrator. And at the bottom of that conversation there's a prompt in markdown. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we want to copy paste that into the chat box. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, no, that's the one. Just making sure that it's copying the markdown instead of like dragging and copying, you know what I mean? Okay. Yeah, cool. Yeah, let's send it and see what happens. Let's see if it breaks. Okay, let's see. Project overview, project name MVP, use case objectives, develop a bot that sends two dues after meetings and allows clarification of assignments, scope checking, assigned valuables, tasks and team member capacity, significance enhancing, meeting summaries and project management efficiency, Cuba and then unspecified team members. Sure. Weird. Course experience in starting the rag system from a single document transcript. External stakeholders no specific mention the provided context. So it might not be taking enough immersion. But this is good. This is a good start. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOverall, the MVP use case project aims to develop a bot for post meeting to do clarification with a focus on enhancing project management efficiency. The team led by Kuba, lead at Kuba, is currently working on addressing challenges related to prompt structure by considering the use of markdown. That's definitely not how we are. Oh yeah, no, you did mention that Bartek. That's right, using markdown for the prompt. Future plans include implementing the bot functionality and exploring further improvements in using markdown. Feedback from the team emphasizes the important structure information for effective project management. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell what model for this use? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGPD? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFour or 3.53.5? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh well, let's try the same thing with four and see what happens. The rag, though I might be tripping, but the rag query wouldn't change based on the model. Or yes, the actual words that are being asked to the vector database change based on the model. Or is it the interpretation of the answer from the vector database that changes based on the model? Because that is kind of what we're trying to solve with the rag extractor is creating better queries for the vector database. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, instead of thinking about it, let's do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Is it clear what we asked? Yeah. If you can change the model from 3.5 to 4 January 25 and repeat the same question. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBartech, could you start working on the rag extractor agent? That feels like the hardest problem, creating good vector database queries. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, the one thing I was wondering about, because I will have to make some research because I wasn't really using that much of vector database. I mean, I played around one time like three months ago, I was playing with pine cone. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut since then I have some resources for you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, that would be useful. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Thank you for the honesty. We can't all be experts at everything, but we can try. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nActually, we haven't even do much of rug at all. We just make automations that most of the time they rather generate stuff than answer stuff. Yeah, I've been focusing mostly on prompt engineering this past month. Really deep, deep into what you can achieve with prompting. And we most of the time do like make automation and then some prompting. That's the main engine of the automation in. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight, right. We have committing the changes in Kuba, commit changes to GitHub and we can actually, it's cool that we can actually all test it. So cool. Okay, let us see what happens. Shut the fuck up, bro. Are you kidding me? It answered, I don't know. Fantastic job. And GBT four goes. I don't know, dude. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nWhat? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe honesty. The honesty. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMaybe we shouldn't make models that are that honest. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nExcuse me. I was gone for a minute and everything. What happened? Is it answered, I don't know. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe improved the model and now it answers, I don't know. Could you try one more time? Let's put stochasticity on our no. For a new chat because now it thinks that it doesn't know and it'll try to self justify itself. Another thing I learned from the David Shapiro video you shared. I guess you got to restart from terminal. Oh, yeah. Let's try running that one more time in a clean chat because, I don't know, it's not satisfactory. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor me. It feels like maybe there was some problem with rag. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd that's weird. Why? The rag extractor agent is priority. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. I'm also thinking how much of the heavy lifting can do PFA if we just give the document that's in the pancon to the PFA. Yeah. I think I can walk around my lack of the vector database querying skills by just giving the prompts for the context agent and redo this prompt to be querying this knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut we can do better than that. Let's find some resources. I will send everybody some resources on good database querying and then we feed that to PFA. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. Awesome, Goldie. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSweet. Yeah. And we learn while we're at it because I also need work on that. I think we all need work on proper querying. Avi would be able to teach us on that. Avi would be able to guide us. Oh. Live demos. How. I love you. You always fail. You always fail. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nLet me. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, sounds good. Take your time. Well, we're already at 1 hour. Man, time flies with you guys. This is so fun. I want to make sure that I capture everything. Bartek, you are working on rag extractor. And Alejo, you are sending resources for Lang chain. Lang chain sending resources for rag querying. And we're going to keep it there. Hubby, I'm going to send you some tutorials, examples, colab notebooks that would be with a certain level of complexity to then try to replicate on your end. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. Also, discord channel for this project. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGood idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you. Thank you, Barta. Good idea. Very good idea. Otherwise we're blowing up the development channel project. Personalized? No, not personalized. Knowledge. Now, I think it's all one name, but let's see how I feel. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOne word, don't know. Again, something is very wrong. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Did you terminate the program and then. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nYeah, I think. Is there like a system prompt? Like a system prompt? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe need a system prompt. We need a system prompt. We need a system prompt. We need a system prompt. Okay, we need a system prompt. The prompt goes with the context into the context agent. Okay? Kuba. The system prompt is the context agent prompt. So we're going to add the system prompt and then we're going to have the user prompt be this question, whatever question we ask it, plus the global context or the other way around. The system prompt is the context agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPrompt, and then context agent as a separate prompt. And the system prompt is the context. The one pager, maybe you have some tweaks. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, so I think we're kind of on the same page. But let's see. Go to figma and we can draw it out real quick. So this human input and the global context, the PFA context enrichment agent, the objective to fix an enriched prompt. So it's going to be the prompt that Barta came up with, system prompt. And at the end of the system prompt, and this is my ideal, we can talk about it. At the end of the system prompt is, here is the context of the team or company that is asking context document. Well, global context document. And then we put as input is the human prompt. So when this prompt is like, hey, what does the supervisor agent do? It would already have the context agent prompt. And at the end of the prompt. So these are one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is part of the system prompt. At the end of the system prompt, it would be, here's what the company is about. Now that you know what the company is about, here's what the human wants to know about. And human prompt, what does the supervisor agent do? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLooks good. I would just switch the global context to be first, like before the context prompt, because you need to know the context first to enrich the context. Okay, what you're saying after the prompt, this should be in the beginning of the prompt. And then the prompt goes, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nJust so we're on the same page. Oh, I wasn't sure the screen was I. Oh, no, I was. Very quickly, Bartech. I just want to make sure, because this is a big difference. Fuck. Where is it? I lost it. Where is it? If you have to go. Okay, I found it. Knowledge. Now I'm sharing it, that the global context would be up here. The global context. Okay. Yes. Global context goes up here and now. It's like, hey, with this global context, this is who you are. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, well, good things to test knowledge. Now, remember that we are going to test the placement of the global context at the system prompt. These are going to be fun to look back on. Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Bartek. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOr down or in the rack. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe'll see. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, let's continue this asking and send me the one pager. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe'll do. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSee ya. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSee you, Bartek. See ya, Kuba. We are going to, for now, put that big prompt as the system prompt of your agent. And when Bartech fixes that part, when Bartech creates that new version with the global context document, then we'll change it and then we'll go from there. Cool. If you could commit your changes to GitHub, that would be awesome. So we can all have access? No, you're good. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nCould you share the resource for the route you mentioned? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, I'll send it in the discord. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nAll right, thanks. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. And Kuba. Hubi connect. And Hubi, your challenge is going to be to build the same. Well, build a similar system that Kuba built in your own words, in your own code. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSure. I would be ready till evening. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAwesome. Let's keep going forward, you guys. \\n\\nSpeaker 4\\nBye bye. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThanks. Bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-14 Dev Meeting - Knowledge Now Update, Context Agent Prompt, Chatbox, i dont know funny fail bloopercleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nYesterday, Kuba showed me his elank chain code, and I had some few questions for him, but the rest, I think it's pretty clear for me. I'm planning to do that code by myself. Something similar over the weekend. I hope it will be done.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGreat. Also over the weekend, definitely. This will most likely help you with the assignment, which is checking out the resources I tagged you on. I've been looking at different resources for many months, and these are some of the best that I've gathered around Langchain and rag. And there's also a new one, which might be a distraction from this assignment, which is knowledge graphs. And the question has been, if rag is the component of knowledge, now, that is going to be the trickiest to do. Right. How can we improve rag from the foundation? One way that we have come up with is the rag extractor agent. So create grade queries optimized for rag. Another way might be knowledge graphs, which instead of semantic similarity, touches on relationship. So semantic almost relationships. The six resources I shared, specifically the three or four that I tagged you in, find the time to get into and emulate. There's some colab notebooks in there. I want to emphasize how much value and how much growth you're going to get from truly absorbing those resources. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. But did you mainly learn from that deep learning course?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFor me, personally, no. For me, Rag has been a very application oriented sort of field I explored as opposed to code oriented. It's been more about finding the applications for which it's useful. That's how knowledge now sort of started making sense in my head. This is what I want. This is the application that I want. How do we get there? And obviously, Langchain engines and rag was the most straightforward way.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I'm also on the journey. I'm also going to be starting to learn because I didn't have time yesterday. Today I scheduled some time to dig into those.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNumber one, we have from here, because Fridays there's not going to be a dev meeting. There is going to be an async update. Kind of like last week, Hubi, how you shared like, hey, this is one thing I'm proud of this week and one thing I'm tackling for next week. We're going to tweak it a little bit. And on Monday we're getting together to teach each other about one resource that we dove into for Langchain. Let's put it tangible, kind of like how Kuba showed. That helps a lot with understanding it. Understanding the failures too. So as we play around with it, what do we have to make better? Becomes a lot more real. And that's the reason to go into test driven development.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. And also I was still thinking about this rack query agent, and I think we should get clarity first on the context agent and on the actual context. So I would need the one pager. I mean, I can start working on the rack query agent, but I will not finish it until we have the context agent with the one pager because I feel they are interconnected.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, not yet. Let's get that to you by tomorrow. Finished is never going to be heftable. Is a whole different question. I'm hearing you. I'll get you that context one pager by tomorrow. It's very important that we start making this system tangible as days go by and we work on components and subcomponents. This gives us clarity on why and what comes next. What comes before.Speaker 2\\nAnd that's what we upload to the knowledge base. Otherwise, we're just going to have bad documents in the knowledge base. Right? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo to get some clarity and understanding, you want to actually focus more on that first part right now, let's focus on the cleaning more and let's have some more prompts for cleaning. Maybe outrages. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, actually, what I'm saying is I'm taking care of that part, all right? To make sure that we have good data. And because I've been managing this massive amount of data for months now, I don't want to offload that task into anybody else. It wouldn't make sense. It would just be a waste of time. So what I'm saying is I'm making sure that we have the highest quality data that we can right now, and we might come up with better methods of cleaning and parsing and all that stuff, but making sure that our agents, what we test out of our agents doesn't get noised up, doesn't get dirtied by bad data, which is obviously critical. So allowing you to do your best work with the. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou know, I'm thinking also, because I still remember this prompt that was so shocking to us when you make the first one at PFA, about the transcript. Yeah, this one could be actually useful in here. We should dig that out. I'll maybe search for this in our messages. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, yeah, it is in our messages, isn't it? Yeah. Let's see. I have the cleaner. I'm going to throw that prompt into PFA so we have actually something decent to work with. Hey, have you thought of this topic? Switch. But have you thought of gifting PFA to this Texas client. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWell, I did. Yeah, I did. But we are not sure where is a good time to do that. Right now. He's quite focused on give me the centralized database and I want a chatbot to talk with it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOf course. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd the prompt would come after the system is set up and the chatbot is ready, and then he can think about, okay, now I need the prompt, but it's like three months later from now at least. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. We thought about it, but there is no tangible value, I think, for this client right now, as he's not himself. He is a user of AI, but I don't think he's that much heavy user and that he's rather make me some automation and rather than I use GPT, like this type of AI user, like meta user, let's say. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I was actually thinking of his investors. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI was thinking. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI was thinking giving PFA to his investors. How do you double, how could you, for a client, double the price and then being like, oh, yeah, we'll pay double the price. And PFA feels like one of those. Feels like one of those. I can deliver in the tangible, in the product that you need, and I can also deliver massive amounts of value on this other front, it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's kind of a good idea. But we need the PFA swarm, I think because PFA GPT is just too many percentage of a chance that will go wrong on the presentation. It's a funny thing, when I use it for my work, it works like a charm 90% of the time, but when I want to show it to somebody, it's like 20% of the time it works. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBut that's just live demos, man. That's a function. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, but if we have swarm, we have more control. If we have whole system called PFA, coded up many prompts in the self evaluation stuff, we have way more control. And in GPT, you cannot even set temperature. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI hope that you see how knowledge now feeds into the PFA swarm, which feeds into knowledge now, which feeds into PFA swarm. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's inception. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, it's beautiful. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt's really in the movie from a. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDesign perspective, it's very beautiful how those two things feed into each other. So we are not meeting tomorrow. I want to then take these next few minutes to tackle some topics. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo, I digged up the chat that you shared with me, but there is not a prompt in there, which is just two initial messages and not the actual prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet me find it over here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI bump you the chart. Although I think you have to find it in your chat history of your chart. GPT. Maybe you can at least get the title, I think from this one. Yeah, you have transcript analytics automation. So you can look for this title in your chat histories and you will get the prompt. Because actually this prompt, even though it was the version of PFA, was before latent space engines, it was quite, I mean, like, that was fucking good prompt, dude. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nQuite good. It was incredible. It literally blew my mind. You saw it live. How much? Let's see. Transcript cleanup prompt. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, let me also dig out the video from this call. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, definitely we have the prompt. No, we don't. Part two, autonomous agents. What did you need the full conversation? Because the prompt is right there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo, the final prompt that was conveying all these things, considering, because I only see the two initial messages. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, where it says part two, that was the prompt where it says integration of sentiment analysis, no inclusion of nonverbal cues analysis. If video or audio elements are available, suggest analyzing nonverbal cues or tone variations for a more nuanced understanding of the meeting atmosphere. This one. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI was looking for the black window with the code, and I forget that this version didn't add it. The black window, the code box in the chat you have now. When you're using PFA, you just have the black box. And before, I didn't do that before in this version. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt's just text. All right, so this is the problem, actually. Yeah, I just skimmed through that. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm going to share screen one more time. We're going to look at the system as a whole, and we're going to drop off because we know what we have to do. The assignments are clear again. So knowledge, now we know what we're going for. With the MVP discord bot, we can keep track of these assignments, get brainstorming, get clarity on why this assignment matters and where it fits into the whole system. I'm working on the global context. So it's a one pager of each team and briefly, each and Hubi, this is where it's obviously really very relevant to you, which is from a prompt like we've done with Cuba. There's a chat box. You don't need the chat box. You can just do it from the terminal. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe PFA context enrichment agent, which is going to be the system prompt of the first agent that you implement. Well, actually kind of the only agent for now what Cuba was doing was there's one agent. A prompt gets asked. The agent asks the vector database queries. The vector database returns the chunks, interprets the chunks and answers the human. So it's essentially a single agent that can query the vector database. That's why Lang chain is so useful, because it does those steps for us. The cool thing is going to be this multi query, and one of the resources that I tagged Bartek and Cuba on is a lesson from the land chain handbook and we might get the author of that book to come speak with us. Actually, this is a wild possibility, but it's a kind of acquaintance of mine. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat they came up with is, well, what if you create variations of the query for the vector database? So it asks variations, semantic variations of the same question. So we'll get similar but different chunks in one way enriching the answer from the vector database. So we aim for the rag extractor agent to do exactly that. Bartech, let's try, I'm going to try to get a stubborn knowledge base of all these resources that I sent from which the rag extractor agent might be able to take the most useful concepts, most useful examples to create the prompt where PFA might take this knowledge base of this is the Langchain handbook. This is how you query a knowledge base. This is how you optimize the queries to the knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNow create a prompt for an AI that does the rag extraction, multi query and all that stuff. So let's test both go crazy with the rag extractor agents and maybe on Monday I send you a knowledge base which then we try to recreate the prompt and maybe we can test to see which techniques does it adopt. And we'll talk about latent space activation. Right. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, because it's been trained with all this knowledge, like it knows Lang chain. Lang chain is March. It started getting really big even before GPT four came out. So even with the knowledge cut off, how can we activate that lame space and the hyper reasoning abilities? Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nJust one question. Do we have the length chain already set up in a minor? So I could test those prompts in the agent sequence because currently. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou can test, I can get what Cuba built and you can try the, right, so you're asking for the rag extractor agent, right, for this new agent. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI mean, look, I'm going to make in this rag extractor agent today and when I'm going to be testing it, I would like to have this sequence where we have already some knowledge base or the transcript uploading somewhere and then I can ask the query and then I can have it go through the context agent first and then through the rug extractor agent because the rug extractor takes as an input what the context agent produces, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd we also need the query and also need the transcripts. So that would be essential for testing it properly. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes, definitely. So we'll get Kuba's current code and then essentially next to that you can add the PFA rag extractor. All right, cool. Part of why the resources for Langchain are going to be useful is, well, how do I chain agents together, which I don't know yet. So that's something I'm going to explore as well, useful for all of us. Does that answer your question? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. Awesome. And then I'm working on getting some very clean transcripts from this last month. I think the scope of all of this is going to be this last month where we talk about real estate automations, we talk about the personalized outreach system, and we talk about knowledge now. So it's vast and trying. It could get confused with the different projects. Right. So that could be a good test. And then we'll get to the evaluator agent and such. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think we could use the Avi have this idea of Gates data gates. Because he is busy now. Right. I don't see him much. So does that mean we don't have capabilities to do that or we still kind of. This idea goes to the page. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm going to ask you to go through each of these resources because there's also that in here. It's this one vector search with metadata filtering. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right. I still see the figma, though, but it's in the discord. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo I'll just find it because you're sharing Figma still. So I didn't see what you were highlighting yet. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHere. So I know it looks a little crazy. I went like super deep on these resources, so please be patient with me and go through these resources. And this one, metadata and vector databases. That is the gated information access. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right. Because I thought it's just some. Avi had some crazy idea for R D or something. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, yes, and this is the foundation of that. All right, where could Avi take it? Let's bring a demo to him. And I am sure that he could make some time to brainstorm with us where to take it from there because it's a fantastic idea. But again, if we ingest all of these resources, we might get to the point where we can debate with Avi the best methodology rather than just asking him that. I'm sure over the last several months I found many of these resources and then it took like an hour yesterday to curate the right ones for us. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I actually wanted to start digging into those yesterday, but I was just so already buzed out from the whole day. And I'm also heavily on getting more in depth on the AWS for this project. My brain is just getting double the connections in this week. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWell, do yourself a favor and go create a NATO us migration knowledge base. They have many API docs actually, and I just want to quickly show you something that I can't say I came up with it, but it's been super fucking useful. Aws data migration API docs let's see. Migration service documentation. Wonderful. Bam. Xml sitemaps generator create sitemap bam. And it starts looking at every page from the root page. Usually it works. This is weird. API reference usually works. Dandy. Let's see, let's try this one. Live demos. I'm telling you, it never felt like that. It might be Aws has some blockers. Yeah, it feels like it's Aws. Okay, we'll figure it out. But even just like hey, open them all up and put the links in a CSV. What do you do? Go to relevance and it's the simplest thing in the world. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSomething is cutting you off. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh sorry. Let's see, maybe not. So it's in API docs scraping. They have kind of a website scraping option and what it does is it'll extract the content if it's too long it will kind of cut some of it. But how you use it is hey, what is the URL and what is the objective of the scraping? But that's for one URL. Well you can run in bulk so you have this link. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut your use case is building a knowledge base out of the docs. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nExactly. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nFor like AI to help with the project. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSomething like this, something like that. Something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nActually GPT four knows that stuff. I just make a prompt with PFA and basically it helped me to make a whole assessment for the project and what tools we're going to use and feasibility and for sure for actually making the migration. Maybe it would be useful to have that knowledge base. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat is my point. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut also it's more of for the conversation with the dev. Actually I'm learning more of this way I'm going. And also I'm thinking the GPT four actually knows a lot about AWS so I'm still not sure if that's not overkill to make the knowledge base where he already know most of it in the training data. So I actually make a very good prompt to extract it through latent space and I think it's all right, but I still want to know these things. Not even like wanting for the talking with their developer, but I still need to know this in my head. It's still knowledge that I have to possess to feel good with doing this project. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's been very useful for new APIs. For example, the follow up boss API is 250 pages. And I did that. Exactly that. I created the sitemap enriched by just scraping the website and I fed it to cloud. And cloud has great recall, so it's been super useful in not getting stuck with a new API. And I actually just did it with Firefly's API. Actually, I just did it today and I didn't have to worry about anything because it was a much more complex API than I thought and it has its little tricks. So I'm not an expert with APIs, but now I'm learning so much through scrape the docs or like sidemap scrape the docs, created a GPT, but cloud has been a little nicer. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I usually just go the PFA with the knowledge base, create a GPT, give it the knowledge base again and go from fun. It's been very fun. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's a fine workflow for doing this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd the last thing before we log off, have you guys seen Devin? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI've seen a video on it. Like David Shapiro says, it's not something. It's like not shocking. His title was David Shapiro video. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I queued it up. I loved the title. It was so funny digging at Wes Roth because he keeps putting like shocking in his videos. Yeah, it's funny. I wonder what he's testing exactly. I know the YouTube algorithm that goes into that, but he's overdoing it and I think it's on purpose. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou mean like a west raw with the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOr was it Dave Shapiro? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat's putting shocking in every video. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think it's just now like AI space YouTubers joke. Yeah, it's driving engagement. Because if people see that there is a title like this everywhere, they keep commenting and like, oh, again, like know everybody driving engagement. Actually, the title of the Javi Shapiro from yesterday got me thinking, maybe we should make a title like this for PFA. This is not shocking AI prompt engineer because it will set expectations to the other side. And also later we maybe shock some people. Who knows? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, who knows? I love that. Bring that up with Paige. That's fantastic. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, we're definitely going to do that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe got to set some calendar actually because we already have around 2 hours of content about PFA. So in the process of making long form and shorts are already there. And like next week or maybe even this weekend, we publish some shorts and definitely need a content calendar for that and start working on titles, strategy for publishing it and going from one step to another. I'm not sure if maybe we have a bigger meeting video. Yeah, definitely. I'm thinking if we should have maybe a bigger meeting for content strategy or I should just talk about this with page alone or we should have think. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat that is a fantastic idea. Right now our priority is sales. So all the marketing outreach salespeople are dedicating their time to the email campaign. We're launching it tonight actually, and after that we can make some time. I think it's a fantastic idea. Bartech. Let's all get together and create a content strategy. Yeah, cool. Kubi, if you haven't seen Devin, I'll send you a video. It is shocking. It is a good representation of what we're going for. But Devin is specifically a software engineer we're going for useful for everybody in a company, tailored for anybody in a company. It's a good image of what do we mean by these multi agents working together. The autonomy that these multi agents have. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIs this something similar to rack system? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt very much is rag and taken to the next level. I do wonder where the Rag component comes in because it's a fantastic software engineer and either it's great latent space activations through the system prompt or actual knowledge bases that are getting preread. So I wonder exactly what it is. I wonder where the multi agents come in because it has to be multi agent. There's no way a system that's that good is built over the LLMs that we currently have. A system that is that capable of meta reasoning, of reasoning over itself, not in a consciousness and self awareness way, but yes, you'll see it in the video. You'll see it in the video. Okay, cool. You guys, I will see you on Monday and I will see you on the chat. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe have one assignment for all of us, which is we dig into one resource. And on Monday we essentially demo what we learned from that resource, as basic or as advanced, as specific or as broad as that resource may be. Go over each of the resources, figure out which is the one you want to dig into, and on Monday we talk about it. Each of those is going to help us build better systems. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut I don't think I will be able to attend on the death call on Mondays as usual. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause of the time? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, because of the time. At the time I am in school on the campus. Last time I was on the break. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nExcuse me, what time do you come back home? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat time do I back home? Let me see. It's 05:00 p.m., no. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe'Ll do you on Tuesday. Could you send to the scheduling channel what your times look like next week and we'll figure out where everything fits. Okay, I'll tag you in the scheduling channel and you can share like this is where I'm available, this is when I'm not available so we can all work better together. Okay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf the meeting is the same hour as today, I can attend every day of the week but no Monday. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, good to know. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut every other day is fine for me. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe days that we can't attend, we send an update on the development chat. Kuba isn't here so he'll send an written update in the development chat. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I'll try to make sure that we all have as clear tasks as possible. So even if it's a written update, it makes sense with everything else that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe'Re working with and try to get this code from the Cuba once he makes the update or something. So I would have by the evening something to test on. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSounds good brother. Cuba will be on in about one or 2 hours so we'll make sure that he sends that. All right, cool. I'll see you guys later. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, see Yamani. Bye. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-15 Dev Meeting - no updates, learning rag together, demoing lessons next meetingcleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nFred at Fireflies is not joining for some reason.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, Fred.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's helpful.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. And leave the numbers to machines by the sea.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'm working on it. Now we have way more than four messages, so I'm trying to kind of.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. You want to share screen?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I got you here.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFinding business emails address has proven to be a lot more annoying than I thought.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. When you texted me that this morning, it gave me flashbacks because even when were using zoom info, the data just wasn't as accurate as you would hope for the amount that you pay Zoom info to give you that data.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI see. And that's why I asked you for a manual. Two manual suggestions.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, pretty much every real estate company I know of lists all their agents online, has all their contact information on their own website.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo what did you think about the. Call me, talk to me.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I think obviously ton of experience. So he was super insightful.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI totally agree with him that he likes it. It's good. That's awesome. We definitely have a lot of fluff in there that doesn't need to be there. So let's get rid of the fluff.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAwesome.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIs that.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, yeah, perfect.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOne thing that he mentioned, which is a must, is all the subject lines are lowercase.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt was synergy or synergy. Yeah, there was a couple, but that was one of them.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThen let's do it the other way around because I'm sure it's incredibly tough to know which comments belong to what.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nStop share.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI was trying to catch as verbatim what he was saying.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe want to help them feel this email is only for them. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt better be accurate. So I don't know if this is too much of a risk, given the lead list we're working with.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere are a lot of AOL and MSN email addresses in there, and it makes me very nervous.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSure's my thought on that. I agree that if we're attempting to use that personal interaction of we saw you there, definitely, like Nico said, it has to be accurate and relevant.Speaker 1\\nFair. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou know what I mean? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThere's a lot of discourse about AI in the LinkedIn crowd. So if we then it will, in a counter way, be less likely that they're involved in the AI discourse. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSay that one more time. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, let me rephrase. In LinkedIn, there's a lot of conversation about AI. So if you are on LinkedIn, you've probably seen a lot of the conversation or taken part in some of the conversation, and that is part of our ICP, they are open and kind of relatively involved in one way or another. So if they are on LinkedIn and our email says LinkedIn, and they open the email and it's about connecting real estate and technology, then great. And if they are not in LinkedIn, then kind of in reverse. They're less likely to be involved in the AI conversation, which is thriving in LinkedIn. So if they're not in LinkedIn, they are likely less of our target, of our ICP, less close to us. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. But that right there immediately qualifies. Right. Because then we know if they're involved or not involved most. So that's, I think, a good place to go. Okay. Saw you on LinkedIn. Do I need to keep the hash marks here? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, those are just for us to keep track of. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's what I thought. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut this is not a variable anymore. We're just using LinkedIn yeah. Saw you on LinkedIn. Found you on LinkedIn. Saw you on LinkedIn. Saw your LinkedIn. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow many characters is that? Something like 40. I don't think we're going to get to the word synergies on their phone. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMaybe we flipped the sentence, thought we could find some synergies, saw your LinkedIn, something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, let's do that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe'll tweak the verbiage in a sec here, but at least put that at the beginning. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFucking. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI spilled Red Bull on my keyboard. Now some of the keys stick. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is so hilarious. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I got to pop them all off and clean the fucking receiver. I'm not doing that right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm happy to edit if it's more of a pain for you. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo, it's okay. It's only a few. It's mostly just commas. So if you see a long line of commas. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's why you were so fucking jittery that you dropped your can. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, it was so cold and frosty, like a fresh beer. Right. I picked it up and it just slipped right out of my hand. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, my God. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. We have many others to go through. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, we got to be efficient here. Thought we could find some synergies. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGood copy paste. Oh, no, because we have all the messages, all the notes here. Okay, moving on. We're going to test this variable when we transfer, but let's keep going with the notes. I found some synergies with progressive folks in real estate, and I found your LinkedIn profile quite insightful. Enjoy discussing trends in the industry and cutting edge technology applications and cutting edge AI applications and newer and new AI apps. New tech apps. New technology apps. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat about just cutting edge technology? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhy say that if we mean AI? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I need some synonyms for this. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCutting edge AI technology. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd cutting edge feels. Marketing. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, I enjoy this. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDoes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nEspecially with the surge of AI. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEspecially with everything new in AI. The surge? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSurge in AI technology. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEspecially around new things in AI. Trying to keep it, like, simple. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, new things in AI. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWords to somebody. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI don't know if I like how new things sound. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI don't either. New tools. Yeah, I did that down here and we changed it to GPT. I mean, we're talking about GPT, right? So should we just say GPT? But it goes beyond that, technically. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNew AI tools. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNew AI tools. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat hits our ICP. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. New AI tools. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Let's go to our zoom coffee. Have a feeling we'll find some of our interests aligned and then we'll put the variable date. So if it's today, then are you available anytime this week? Are you available anytime next week? We can change, right. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDepending on the day. Like Thursday, Friday. You got to push to next week. But Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, you could do this week. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHave a feeling we'll find our interests a lot. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. I'm going to copy paste. That looks weird, but we know what it is and we can change. Are you available anytime this week? Are you available anytime next week? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe'd be sending this out Thursday. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo if today is less than four, meaning Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I think that's what this means. Then are you available anytime this week? Otherwise, if it's Thursday Friday, are you available anytime next week? So if it's Thursday Friday, should we say, are you talk. Monday, Tuesday, work. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMonday. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat do you think of needs here? Sorry, go ahead. A Monday Tuesday. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSynergies. Right. Synergies. Interest. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGot it. Yeah, we're good. Monday or Tuesday? Monday, Tuesday. Yeah, I think Monday Tuesday is fine. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThird Friday. Oh, no, that's not the code. So if the thing in the brackets is the code and the thing outside the brackets is the words that would come out. So if today is less than four, which is forest. Thursday. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Awesome. Otherwise, Monday, Tuesday. Cool. What is a better format? Because we're not really going for the super formal, but I think casual. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMun twos. There's fry. I mean, we're in the US, there shouldn't be any confusion of what we mean. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Dope. Sick. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, I'm going to copy this into instantly. Are you ready for me to do that? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, great idea. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nLet's do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFucking abro. What's wrong with me? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think you need sleep. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's the problem I can probably fuck with. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, you can. So I'm going to let you do that's. Wait, refresh that page because I have a B on there that you don't have. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou have to click save on anything. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. I haven't saved it yet. That makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSuper annoying. It shouldn't be that way. Variables. Come on, give me other code. View preview. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHold on. Try to refresh the page again because I just saved synergies. There should be a whole message there. There we go. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSynergies. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe'll change. Juggling the chaos in a minute, but cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe will work on that one. And. Come on. There has to be a way. I'm going to look up two things. In the meantime, let's jump to the next email yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo, variation two. We're leaving as it is right now because that'll be a swap for a. But let's go to message two. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow to add tagline to email. Done. Yeah. Okay, so, time and day, variable. Bam. Fine. Now, case, handle. Went Monday. It's Monday. When? Tuesday. Hello. Tuesday, I. Wednesday. Happy Monday. Happy day of the week. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPut it there. And it's Friday. Will it double happy. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. Very good question. So then we go to the things that are not in brackets and we say. That's what we want to say. We would say, happy Monday, happy Tuesday, happy Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Cool. But you wouldn't really say happy Tuesday. Yeah, fuck it. I always do that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nActually, I do too. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPrime of the brain. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen why discriminate against. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt? Gets closer to Wednesday and nobody wants to be in a Wednesday. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMaybe. Hello and happy. Do we have that already, or hello and happy. Yeah, like, hello and Happy Monday. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHello and Happy Monday. We can, if you want. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nJust an idea. I got a list of a few. In them. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLess words the better. We can try it. I'm not sure. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, no. Less words the better. Happy day of the week. As long as you guys are fine with that. I'm fine with it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI know it's the week. Will the campaign run over the weekend? That was your question. And he wrote something, right. Where was it? Page. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHe did. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt was Nico message, had a meeting. I'm happy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI know it's the weekend, but I'm excited to see your profile changes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhere is that? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I found it in. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, wait, a different version of it, remember? Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh, it's at the bottom, I think. The only thing I have that he wrote is Nico message. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis one. Hey, John, please don't answer to Monday. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd then we worked on it and it was like, I know it's the weekend. And that was so I think. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe were talking about using relevant Google, the address, and find coffee shops or local places in the areas where they work to relate with them. I don't know how much we actually dug into the copy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. So let's go over the copy then. He said, there is a way for certain emails to be sent only on certain days, certain variations to be sent only on certain days. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHe did say that. Don't know if he explained how, but. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHe sent me this document that should say, how cool. Based on day of the week greetings, based on the week meetings, based on the week, inserting the day of the week, inserting yesterday's date. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIs it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nStill here? Listening. I'll be back in 2 seconds. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHe made it sound like an email will not be sent unless it's like a day of the week that you assigned. But what I showed him is like, well there is no option for that. You can schedule it, but there's also no option for which schedule to use. It's either this one or that one. And that was like strange. Insert link more text templates. Maybe add step strange. Okay, let's just move on. Spin tax creating variations of sentences or words random. Okay, cool. If you try to set the variables day. Okay, well, code view now at the bottom what this line does. Variable position. You can also. Okay, well maybe for the next one. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I just googled it. It seems like we need to do a few more steps. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo let's table that we can go with this. We remove that. I got excited when I saw your LinkedIn profile and noticed a lot of palace we both work on. Good to find things that they resonate with, I. E. That we're both interested on and noticed a lot of notice. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nA lot of parents. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, right. And the next sentence is we're in the real estate space and I'm really into new technology. You have to decide on we or I. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat do you guys think? I like the Wi. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd really into music knowledge. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I generally like wi. I'm trying to think about. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe Wi sounds too generic to what are they trying to sell? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut that's just to me. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, maybe I is more personal. That's true. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNotice a lot of parallels. Cut that sentence there. I got excited when I saw your LinkedIn profile and noticed a lot of parallels, period. I'm also in the real estate space. I'm really into new technology. I'd love to understand how you're utilizing chat GPT today. Love to, love to meet to discuss how you are. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDiscuss understand chat about. We'd love to meet and discuss. We'd love to meet and chat about. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I like chat. But then we're using chat GPT, so you can't use the same word twice. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd yeah. Understand how you're using chat GPT today. I like it today. And then you go into Wednesday, Thursday, how you're using chgbt I would be sending. That's what you meant. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool, that's good. Unless you want to do the testing swap here. Do you want to try doing the same thing we did for the first one with the subject line and the tagline where you're using the word in the first phrase? You know what I mean? Or do you want to test it in that we're not using lifestyle automations or whatever our subject line is in the first sentence. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, that's a great idea. Let me remember how to do that. I think it's this one. Now at the bottom of your email, just add this line display non you don't display it and you show the words that you want to say. I think that's how it went. So you go div. So HTML display is don't show this when you actually show the email, but it does show up. This is the tagline, this is the email header. What do they call it? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSubject line? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, email preview. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, that makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo you go into code. Okay, wonderful. I know it's the weekend, I got excited. No, I got excited when I saw your LinkedIn profile and noticed a lot of parallels. I'm also in the real estate space and really into new technologies. Love to connect and understand how you're using chat. GPT does Thursday sound good? Does day of the week? And we say the same thing. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, work sound good? And cta alternative, let's not do alternatives right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo, that was just, yeah, delete it, you're good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHave a productive, have a productive week. What if it's like Friday, we can do the same code and say, yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI was going to say sub for have a great weekend. Yeah, hope you enjoy the weekend. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHave a good start of the week. Rest of the week. Have a good rest of the week. Have a productive start of the week. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is for Friday. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFriday. Then what do we say? And what if it's Monday because we're sending these during weekdays, so could we. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSet it to Friday? Have a great weekend. And if it's any other day, have a great week. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGood, have a great rest of your week. Yeah, okay, cool. If it's less than five, then have a great rest of your week. Have a good, or great, I think great rest of your week. Great weekend. Alejo from faster rice and we put the number. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nPerfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool, lovely. Let's paste it in. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I want to see where you're pasting this in because this is going to be the sub for a right variant or. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, it doesn't really let me. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nVariables at the bottom. What is that? No, that's not it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, did it just die on me? Don't. What's our tagline on this? Lifestyle automations. Having fun automating my life? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe'Re connecting it to the subject line and in this version we're not mentioning automation otherwise. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. So then we got to say something about parallels. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nA lot of parallels. Let me make it easier to see. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think we. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool parallels lifestyle automations understand or learn about would love to connect and learn about how you're using. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nChgt lifestyle parallels we don't necessarily need automations but I don't know if I like lifestyle parallels. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool automations. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nReal estate parallels. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nReal estate automations no, lifestyle automations is our offer. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt is. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe can do variations and just do the subject line as the variation. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's what I was thinking. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. So let's say it is lifestyle automations. What is the tagline? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI got excited when I saw your LinkedIn profile and noticed you may be using lifestyle automations. Noticed you may be in need of now they can't put the offer that soon. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNoticed you had something there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou may be using lifestyle automations. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUsing lifestyle automations question mark. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHow we're seeing lifestyle automation. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo. Is it a question? It is a question. How you're using lifestyle automations. How are you using lifestyle automations? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, phrase it as a question. I got excited when I saw your profile and would like to know how you're using or am curious about how you're using lifestyle automations. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo this is for the tagline. This is like 30. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh yeah. Okay, I got you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAre you using lifestyle curious about lifestyle parallels curious. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCurious how you're using. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCurious about your lifestyle automations curious. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHow you're using or. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCurious how you're using lifestyle automations? Let's go. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat might be too many. Is that too many characters about curious. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAbout your lifestyle automations? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that should work. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Let's hope it works. We can. Zach, let's try mine. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo you can do mine too. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Since I'm sharing screen just yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you for the attention to detail. Oh fuck yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's fucking awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBeautiful. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. And my phone. Let's see my phone. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nFriday. Lois for you with that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nApple. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. Interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAutomation. The N and the S don't come up but that's okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAutomation. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCurious about your last? It's just about. It's two, four, 68, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 28. About 35 characters is what? The lowest it goes. Which is about. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, stay on your email for 1 second. Quick detour, but not really. Click what Nico mentioned not using any capital letters. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCan you explain? I'm, I'm curious. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAbsolutely. Because of this. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. Two spammy promotions. Yeah. Social updates. Okay, I got you. Everybody does that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, everybody does capital letters. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay. Perfect. Question answered. We're good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHe can hear you better. Maybe they're charged now, so maybe I can put them on. Yeah, I just want to make sure they can hear you. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I can only hear bits and pieces. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nPerfect. All right, we're good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBack to now. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nFix the space. Going to bother me. Okay, I think you can fix it in the regular email preview. It's in between the second and third paragraph. There's an extra space. That's the first paragraph. Yes, I. It's underneath the I got excited paragraph. There's an extra space. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt might be two extra spaces. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYes. Because when you look back at how it came through in your email, the spacing is not consistent. It's visually distracting. Well, click into the right. I'm not with you anymore. I see perplexity giving an error. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI don't have. Think your buds died. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, Zach can't hear you. Miamore. Okay, you can hear me? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I got you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. Too much zoom. Got the zoom. Zoomies. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHear me now? You can hear me. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThere we go. I got you. Fuck, I lost you again. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe can just go. No headphones and I'll turn my volume off. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. If you can hear me through his, then that works. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf you can make sure you have the mega sound cancellation on. Yay. I don't know why it's been so weird like that. Okay, moving on. Else. Great weekend. Can you hear us twice whenever you want to speak. Then just. You can unmute that. Have a great weekend. Let's see how that came out in the email. Monday. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nTest that. I'm going to start looking at the next message. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBeautiful. Short. Nice. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBeautiful. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, cool. Done. Saved lifestyle automations. Yay. I'm going to start which spaces? Oh, yeah. No, we're getting there. Div and Div goes in. Div and Div. Thought we could find some synergies. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nJust checking that the name isn't all going to turn out John, because it looks like it's outside the script. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you. Yes. Morning. Afternoon. Evening. Morning. I don't know who thinks 04:00 p.m. Is evening, but afternoon, evening. These are great. Okay. I've found synergies with progressive. This is a politicized word. What do we change it for? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGreed. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWith. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nForward thinking. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nForward thinking is a little too marketing. Maybe with modern savvy. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSavvy. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAlso too marketing. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt's a little marketing. My synonyms are too politically charged. Let's see. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI've found synergies. Doesn't quite. I've had good conversations. We're talking about synergies. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOpen minded. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe are going. That is one of our ICP characteristics. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDoesn't seem too marketing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. I found good synergies with open minded folks in real estate. And I found your LinkedIn profile quite insightful. Pager profile discussing trends in the industry and new AI tools. Connect to our zoom coffee. Have a feeling we'll find our interest line. Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, work. Enjoy the rest of your week. Perfect weekend. Enjoy the rest of the week. Okay, cool. And we call that done. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe've said synergy, synergies so many times. I'm like, should it be plural or should it just be synergy? I found good synergy with open minded folks. I've found good synergies with open minded folks. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFind some synergies. Well, it could be either in this one, but we are expressing some. I know that technically the term is synergy. Synergy is. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nEven if it's multiple, it could be plural or singular. I see what you're saying. Synergies is fine then in that scenario, that makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSynergy is dynamic rather than how many things you align on. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGot it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's semantically in use. People use synergies. Okay, good synergy with open minded folks. Let's move on. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, let's move on. That's cool. I'm in. Juggling the chaos. Just let me save this and then refresh your page. And I put two messages in here because one is the one we started with at the top, and then the one at the bottom is Nico's. You're good to go. I just want to whittle down the one we created to be closer to Nico's. I feel like his is a little short and ours is a little long, so we need to meet somewhere in the middle. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, shit. It didn't save. I was sure I hit save, motherfucker. Dude, are you kidding me? What the fuck? Because you refreshed it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI refreshed my page. All right, let's only have one person in here. I'm getting out. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, let's do that then. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDoesn't act like Google. It's not helpful. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI hope that it would. We're going to copy that over. We know exactly what we're changing. Enjoy. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThe rest of your week. And then. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, the rest of your week. Enjoy your weekend. Great, then. Thought we could find some synergies. Saw your LinkedIn saving code view. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIn the second paragraph. We got to change. Hold on. Yeah, the parentheses, I've found synergies right below. That's think. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat's how it goes. 1212 a okay, what is it? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDown one paragraph? Yes, right there where you have. I've found synergies with progressive folks. I just put those parentheses there before. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut found good synergy. We said found. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI found good synergy with open minded folks in real estate. And I found your LinkedIn page profile. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNow we have found twice in the same sentence. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Was it found? Thought I've. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat was it? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI've. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHad good synergy with open minded focus real estate, and I found a link for about works. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI enjoy discussing trends in the industry and UA tools. Connect over a zoom coffee path, feeling we'll find an interest, align Thursday, Friday. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMonday, Tuesday, come across, whatever, doesn't matter. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, we can distill this forever. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt's fine. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThought we could find some synergies. Saw your LinkedIn and it saves. And now if I go back, we modify this. Good. This is the 17, so 05:00 p.m.. Good. Now we save. And now if I refresh. Love it. Twelve. Okay. Otherwise it's evening. Let's kind of go over some coffee. I've had good synergy. We open my folks in real estate, I find your LinkedIn qualifying further. Let's move on. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHey, subject line, juggling the chaos. Is it to marketing? Is it like, oh, is this a newsletter? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMaybe getting rid of the just juggling chaos. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I think this was the one where he said, just cut out that initial line about us because they don't care about us. Let's keep it about them. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. And what did we change it for? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI think we cut it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I said so. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIn that same message, I copy and pasted his. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe haven't gone over all the comments. That's right. So time of day formula. He said to keep it simple. Keep simple. Include personalization about every remotely associated marketing terms, which, like juggling. So he just said, let me know. Keep it super simple. I'm happy to test because this does talk about juggling the chaos, but this is a call to action, and it's pretty cool. We could decide to a B test just that subject line and maybe put a tagline like figuring out how to deal with chaos. Okay, so next time of day formula. They don't care about us. It's not about us. They care about what we can do for them, only care about them. Had a meeting with an agent last week for coffee, but she forgot to. This is somewhere else below. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I put it right instantly. Already. I copied that whole thing. It's in the thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nA call to action. Let me know if variable date works for you. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nFor this message, can we think about like, in the back of our minds, the female ICP coming from a female email address and designing for female recipients. I don't know if that's. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThen we could only send from page ad email. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I'm just thinking, I don't know if we can't now because we can't choose. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, we can address it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, so then we could choose to only send to females. Interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, yeah. Cool. Good call. Let's see. So, good morning, afternoon, evening. First, are you said this was the one, right? That you copy pasted? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes, that was Nicos. Had a meeting with an agent last week. Coffee, blah, blah, CTA, all that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, had a meeting with angel last week. Her coffee. She forgot to set a calendar for the meeting. Let's be honest. Well done, this. And it just doesn't feel good. We made Emma a solution with AI that makes sure it never happens again. Happy to explain what we did for her to see if you could benefit from it too. Let me know if I'd be happy to show you how. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I like that line. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd this is the variation. That's right, this is the variant. Okay. Page from faster ICE. From faster ICE. We are copying, we are saving. We are getting her phone number. Oh, that was dangerous. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIt was dangerous. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI was getting nervous, but it's fine, it's been synchronized. I'm going to make sure that as I'm working on something, I at least have like save. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nJust take a breath and slow down a minute. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you. We just have a lot more to go through. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI know. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHad a meeting with an agent last week for coffee. Had a meeting with an agent, Emma, last week for coffee. Because we are mentioning Emma here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWe should be mentioning real estate too, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSorry, what page? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI'm thinking about pros and cons of saying someone's name or referring to her. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNico seems pretty keen on the idea. It makes it a lot more tangible and human. And it's true, it's just we're not saying Devon for obvious reasons. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. I just changed the name. Yeah. Emma is the most liked female name in the United States, by the way. I checked. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, fascinating. But what is your concern? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThat someone might think you're blowing up someone else's story, like privacy kind of thing, but that's not really based on anything other than a thought. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's good that we're not, but we are. Does it break our celery test? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, I think I'm thinking about hypersensitive people. I don't think it breaks our celery test at all. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAwesome. Great. Thank you for that comment. Let's move on, then. But, yes, very important that we keep asking ourselves that question. I don't know if we told you about the celery test, Zach. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou haven't. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut I. Another day can infer. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, another day. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's be honest. We've all done this. That doesn't feel good. Anything we should change here other than this? I can get the. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think it's good. Short, straight to the point. I mean, synthesize the story. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, great. Cool. So few things that we're doing here. Afternoon, evening, had a meeting. Let me know if day. I'll be happy to show you. We are keeping this here then. And what we're doing right now is the variable. So let me know if certain day works. We did let me know if this. Let me know if works for you. Patreon. Faster. ICE. Okay, now copying. We're leaving. We're coming back. We're checking. Okay, great. It's there. We're leaving. We're doing tagline. Because we don't have a tagline for that yet. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo coming back. Dookie. We're still good. We're going code. We are pasting. What is our tagline? Balls in the air. Some balls in our hands, some balls in the air. That could fit in 40 characters. How many women? Only two ovaries. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNico's point with juggling chaos being marketing related does make this more difficult, because I want to talk about how do you juggle the chaos? How do you manage the chaos? How do you juggle the work? That kind of thing. But all those taglines seem too marketing track of everything. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHow do you keep track of it all? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nKeeping track. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nKeeping track of it all? Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow do you keeping track of it? Keep track of all of it? Of it? All of all of it? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHow do you keep track of everything? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHow do you balance. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow do you balance everything? How do you keep track? Keep track is the offer that we're selling here. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHow do you keep track of everything? Yeah. Cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis could be a really good a B test. Everything is the same, except the subject line is. Quick question. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe one that Nico had said specifically for this one was let me know name. But he was just throwing that out. It was when were going through this example that he said, let me know name. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I feel like that could be applicable for anything to any of them. But because our tagline question, how do you keep track of everything? I'm just curious how that would sync up with. Subject line, quick question. And then the first thing I see is, how do you keep track of everything? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSubject line, quick question. How do you keep track of everything? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet me know. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEmma, are we testing juggling chaos? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSure. Let's do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. And then that allows us to go a B test. This, too? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's not mixing the A B test because one is open rate and the other one is reply rate. They won't see this before they open. Okay, cool. So I'm going to save, I'm going to go here, I'm going to code, I'm going to paste this, and I'm going to go back. So now we grab this part. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou only need one of those. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSave. Yes. I just want to make sure that this is pasted. This is nice. We still have this. How you keep track of everything. Great. Moving on. And now I'll be happy to show you. Yes, we only need one of these. Happy to explain. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe just need to pick one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo in the other one. So we have been three variations of this, right? Is that what we're. Okay. I'll be happy to show you how Emma and her team are using it to save themselves a lot of headaches. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTo prevent future headaches. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPrevent. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat about using automate to marketing? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. You hop on a call later this week to see if we can do the same for you. Show you how Emma and her team are using it to. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nStay organized. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nStay organized and productive. Yeah, it's a little generic. I'll be happy to show you how Emma and her team are using it to. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe just say it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNever let anything slip. To always keep track. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTo make sure nothing slips through the cracks. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. Dream outcome. Are we declaring the negative or are we declaring the positive? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nPut that down first and then we'll. Using it to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. Right. Happy share. I'm entertainment. Using it to make sure nothing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's be honest, we've all done this and it feels awful. Not just that it doesn't feel good. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I want that to hit harder, too. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I agree. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDifferent paragraphs or one sentence after the other. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI kind of like those separate the way they are. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIs it too much to say Emma and her team are using it to transform text messages into Google? Just name the automation in a succinct. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLike Alex for mostly screaming at me. They don't care about the how. They only care about the outcome. So what is the outcome? The outcome is like avoiding headaches. The outcome is saving time. The outcome is to keep track, which. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIs naturally created events. Hold on. That's what I liked about our message. It was too wordy, but it had a lot of detail. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. It's like I'm making sure that I don't miss anything. With less effort. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo keep track of everything with no effort. How Emma and her team are using it to keep track of everything without to. The tagline is, how do you keep track of everything? How do we look back around? We use the same words, or do you use synonyms? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHow Emmett and our team now spend less time. Are spending less time. No. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nJuggling the chaos. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nEmma and her team. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, they're already open the email. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe talked a lot about. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. And I guess this subject line will be. Quick question. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. So using it to juggle the chaos. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo more juggling the chaos. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause juggling the chaos is chaotic. You don't want to be juggling. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUsing it to not have to juggle the chaos too much. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nDouble negative. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHappy to share. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nTo eliminate juggling the chaos. It's a little too marketing, but let's think of another word. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nShow you how Emma and her team have eliminated the chaos. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe are talking about the awful feelings. So I could see how instead of dream outcome, it's like, let's prevent this from happening. Okay, well, we also have this variation, so we can do this third email with this third call to action, and then just, like, we can try both. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, just same thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nMake sure nothing slips through the cracks. Are you using it to manage the chaos? What did you say? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nUsing it to eliminate the chaos. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEliminate the chaos. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIt's all smooth sailing now. Very salesy. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nUsing it to eliminate juggling the chaos. To make sure nothing slips through the cracks. Let's vote. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI like eliminating the juggling of the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nChaos, using it to the way Zach phrased it was. Are using it to eliminate juggling the chaos. How do you eliminate the chaos? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHaving to juggle the chaos. Eliminate. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHappy to show you how Emma and her team are using it. No more juggling the chaos. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'll be happy to show you how Emma and her team are using it. No more juggling the chaos, period. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Moving on. Let me know if Tuki dookie works for you. Had a meeting with an agent. Quick question. First name. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis might be a little nitpicky, but would we want to say, hey, first name, comma, quick question. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI do like the name being right up there in the beginning, because in most of the marketing emails, I have my name is not in there, but if my name is in there it gets my attention. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Then I'm going to grab this code, copy it. I'm going to create a new variant and it looks weird because it's not in code view. Great. And then this variant is still first name. Quick question. Or the other way around. The other way around. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. We could test two things there. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nComma or. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNah, not in that one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Let's be honest, we all done this. Happy to hop on a call later this week. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo comma in that sentence. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTo see if we can. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nHappy to hop on a call later this week to see if we can do the same for you. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHappy to hop on a call. Happy to hop on a call. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhy don't you just take out, undo that real quick. Yeah, take out later this week there. Happy to call to see if we can do the same for you. Let me know if blank works. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, I suppose to jump. Putting it all in one. Why divide it in two? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nBecause if you put the schedule thing there, then you lose the end of the sentence. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nHappy to hop on a call Monday or Tuesday to see if we can do this thing for you. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAt least in my brain I get stuck on like oh, Monday, Tuesday doesn't work for me. And I don't finish reading the sentence. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. They're almost like. Yeah, they're thinking about scheduling too early. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOne sentence after the other. Happy to hop on call to see if we can do the same for you. Emma. Let me know if Thursday Friday worked for you. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think I like the space. Maybe just because of the codes there. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAnd I think I would capitalize the l there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCool, nice. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd that's that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRun it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWow. Let me copy this fucking thing. I haven't even pulled for fucking leads. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOne thing at a time. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOne thing at a time. Yes, you are right wise. Very wise. Let's preview. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nStill with you just running to the bathroom. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nKate, quick question. Kate and page at transpired journey. That is not how we want to do it. We need to cancel the previous emails and buy new. Yeah, right now Nico has said it's not really an issue because we have all domains for our previous agency. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGot it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd they come up with a whole email as opposed to name. So I'll fix that on our end. I am copying, I am saving and I'm moving on. I'll be happy to show you. Happy to hop. I'll be happy to show you. I'm going to show in the chaos. I am copying and I am saving. What I didn't check is how do you keep track of everything? Quick question. I am previewing and I am sent. Could you read this, Zach, and let me know if that looks good? I'm going to pee. Real? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, yeah, you're good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat looks good on my end. Perfect. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCoffee. I'm just thinking of a couple, like, verbiage tweaks. I don't think we need the a coffee. I think we could just do last week for coffee. I want to change the second to. Let's be honest, we've all done this, and it's an awful feeling. I want to hit them with awful earlier. That's a good sentence. I'll. I want to change to I'd. I will. Or I would. I would be happy to show. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nHow Emma and her team are using it. No more juggling the chaos and then capital L. Yeah, but that's it. Just like some minor tweaks. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAlejo, are you ready to edit? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe're getting comments on our LinkedIn post. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNice. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhose LinkedIn posts? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFrom one month ago. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI was like, I haven't posted on LinkedIn. I guess I'll try to. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's pretty boted. One of them was bought and then I guess. Anyway, what was it? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, so first sentence. Get rid of the A before coffee. You don't need that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nA first sentence. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAt a meeting with an agent. Yes. Just delete that a. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nPerfect. That was one of the changes. The other one that a perfect second paragraph instead of. And it feels awful. I want to hit them with awful earlier. And it's an awful feeling. Yeah, because awful earlier in the sentence. Okay, perfect. Third paragraph. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nGood. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nFourth paragraph instead of aisle. We'll do. I'd. I would. That's it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm saving. Perfect. Copying this. And then. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, now I have to go pee. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCopying here. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe made happy to hop on a call to see if we can do the same for you. Let me know if this works. Okay. And happy to share or do we want to hit explain or do we share in a different version? Explain as I think a stronger connotation so we can stick with it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. I want to keep that there. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll I see is you moving your mouse around. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we'll do some checks. We are checking for subject line tagline. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou found some synergies to all your LinkedIn. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nName. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAre we even mentioning their name? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, if you put a name in that tagline, I would put it as the first thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. I was thinking that. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWe'Re on the same page. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFuck, yeah. Okay. So I am testing this email now. Anything to change. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSynergy with open minded folks in real estate. I found your LinkedIn profile quite insightful. Enjoy. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSite. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDiscussing trend. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet me do you guys a favor there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThese are on the same line. It's nice and short and it's two questions one line. Let's do this in a separate one. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, maybe next line. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I'm just gonna. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGood. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm just gonna go fix something so I can actually test this and see how the name comes up. Because I fucked this up last time and it sucked when it said like it was Alex inspired or something like that. It was bad. Your name is coming up here, man. Putting this gave us so much fucking, so much better deliverability. Absurd. Your name, your name. I don't know why it's not coming up in my email then. Because the whole email is coming up as name. But then if I go to Alex, it's also so strange. See what it. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, let me. What do you want it to say instead of Alex? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell no, I wanted to say Paige and yours but it just shows the whole email. The second email. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, the second email. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI want it to be like Alex. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut I'm thinking maybe it's because his email is Alexander and yours is page instead of what that would. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nVery strange. Let's see. Getting spirit. Journey and page settings. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat if you changed page to like page p dot like page pwom. Just test to see if you put something else there if it's going to act the same. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI had my bowl. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI did that earlier. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's your fault. Oh yeah, I was checking for preview and now I forgot which is the email I changed. Must be this one. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, it is page. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, Kate Alejo. Let me know how it comes through. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNo, it's still showing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWow, that's weird. So weird. Alex, what's the fucking difference? Fast track. Getting inspired. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's the only other thing I was thinking is change something in the last name. But I don't know. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYou go to my account name. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, one sec. Yes, let me try sending this with this new change from Alex page. Getting inspired. Journey AI. What did you want to check? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nEmail account. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, same thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGo into the email. The account for the ones that have page in it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, you were just there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWeird. Show advanced settings. No. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nInstantly name coming up as full email. Suddenly my full name appears and I will look address book email address instead of display name. Clinician sender name. No sender name signatures. It front signatures. It's just like coming right when it's coming right. So weird. Right? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhen you did the last name P, did that change anything or. No, no, same thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I'm sure I can figure this out. Let's move on. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, we have to do what now? Second. Emails. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEmails. Why are my recipients seeing my whole email instead of my name sender name? Is that what you said? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, I think that's what it's called. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou can show a picture? Yeah. Okay, I'll just send them this and move. Okay, let's see. Photos. I got a free consultation call with Nico. He sent me like one for free, which was fucking cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, that's awesome. Was that yesterday or. That's after yesterday. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAfter yesterday he was like, yo. As a early welcome gift to Bali. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNice. Are you going to see him in Bali? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, well, he's living there, that's what. Yeah, yeah. Okay, now go away, dude. I don't need you anymore. I don't need you anymore. Okay, synergies. We're good on this email. Yeah. Good afternoon. Evening. Good morning, Kate. Yeah. Yes, it mapsil automations. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think we can test that. Yeah, see if that good or bad. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nTwo questions in one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAlej. And have a great weekend or have a great rest of your week. Great. Moving on. Yeah, cool. And finally you're just two emails of the other one. Okay. Anyway, we'll get around two more. Think five is a good thing to test? We're testing specific things. It's great. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo you want to do what, one more than we have right now? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, not right now. Are more ideas in the email for the CRM automations we haven't touched on. And then there's variations of a couple and then there's a slew of ideas later on, but that's something. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, we got a ton of valuable info in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Awful feeling we made, Emma, just make sure it never happens again. One of the questions is morning capitalize. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I think so. I mean, I usually do. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Lovely, lovely page from fast rice. We are ready. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nLet's do it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNice. Negative is good. Negative is positive. Okay. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSo now we pause the other campaign and launch this one. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPage'S email is not being used in the other campaign. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, cool. But the other one's done, right? There's no more emails to send to? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, no, there were several sequences. Like up to seven days after, up to eight days after. Something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, so yeah, let it keep going. That makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Enable risky emails. Bounce, protect. No, insert unsubscribe link header enable company reply stop contain for company reply stops the campaign automatically for all leads from a company. If a reply is received from any of them, no matches your leads provider with your mailbox provider for boosted deliverability. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, that's interesting. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis we don't really want to do right now because we want to keep it manual. We care more about insights and less about performance. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSure, that makes sense. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPrioritize new leads, schedule follow ups and max new leads we are going to do. This is nice. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nDo we need to have follow up emails or no? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, remember how in Yogi's emails they did open the second email and although the answers weren't positive. It's good. It's good to have. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSure. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd we're doing up to 30 emails per we're doing up to 30 emails, warm emails per account. So this is 120 and we can open the new domain for fastrise and new emails. Cool. I have to do some lead cleaning still. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI thought you were stretching. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, I'm charging my computer because I get yelled at it. I don't. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThen your computer just turns off for some reason. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI get yelled at. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYou need that chinese nuclear battery that can last 50 years. Never plug it in. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWhat are you talking about? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nSome company in China developed a nuclear battery pack like the size of a smartphone that can supposedly last for 50 years without charging. Seems dangerous. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, right. Especially how much I use my computer these days. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe'Re going to BCC. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWill you just humor me and click on the little circle head icon on the left side. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLeft side. Circle head. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOh, that's lead management. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPlease, no more emails because I'm not interested. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nPlease remove me from your list immediately. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt is admittedly. Yeah. So these are from today. Would you believe this? Greg retired the lead list. Wasn't that good. But the emails were worse. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, we're making progress forward. Slightly disappointing that Yorga is not here right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIs this being recorded? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, got it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nJust curious. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's see. 30 per campaign getting started. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nJourney. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. Very strange. Daily campaign warm up is different. I believe we'll find out. Okay, then we'll try one more time and see what happens. Sequences. We preview. Synergies. Kate. Damn. Number one, get inspired. Journey. Send test. We go to the second one. Preview. Kate. We choose page number two. We send. We preview. Paste, Kate. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWait. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nChange the email. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you. We send. We preview. Paste. Kate. Bam. Send. And then finally we, all of them are coming up as page ad. So we will get in touch with. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut that's different, right? Or is it the same. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDifferent than. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWell, is it her whole email coming up or you're seeing just page and then the ad symbol? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPage ad. The full email. I'm just seeing the full email. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe full email. Okay, I got you. I thought you meant just beginning. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnd if I send this one to me and if I send it from Alex, it comes out all right. It's crazy, man. It's super annoying. Okay, well, I will send this to these guys, I will fix that and I'm going to go work on the leads. Which at the end of the day, yeah, we just don't want. I don't know, I don't know what we want. A lot of them are not. Okay, this is what I can do. I grab all emails that are generic and non work and we only send to those. That could be an option. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOkay, sorry. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI remove all emails that are non work. Gmail, AOL, hotmail, MSN, outlook. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhat's your leftover pool? Is it still big? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWell, we have 850,000. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's what I thought. I think you can delete the. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo instead of delete will you not delete? But I should have to make sure that I organize them very well. So I'm doing the thing that we're telling real estate agents not to do, which is use a CRM, don't use spreadsheets. But it's kind of what we got right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, it is what it is. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut it's exactly what we're saying people shouldn't do. Okay, so I'm going to make a script to make sure we have the right first name. Number one, I'm going to make a script to make sure that AOL, MSN, the general ones, are not in our list. These are emails we're happy with. So we're not burning leads right now. Okay, well, thanks, Zach. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nNo problem. You want to stop the recording? I just want to talk about something real. Yeah. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-15 Outreach Meeting - Final email review before first real estate campaigncleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 2\\nIt was a little issue with our Internet. There was a news that a cable got destroyed, damaged, like, under sea. So people in West Africa, we had issue with Internet because there was a damage to Internet, cable on that. So there was a little downtime for us. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAnyway, so half the weekend was for sort of chilling. The other half was for some focus time. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMy weekend was, as usual, working whole time. We're preparing for the US client. Yesterday, making the deck till 03:00 a.m. At our time with Pavo. My Sunday ends up like this. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThis is a big opportunity. I wanted to share some updates, things that are happening this week. Number one, we are having a Gen Xec this week. A big part of what we're going to talk about is profit sharing. Number two, real estate clients. I have finished the first prototype, so I will be sharing it. Also, what comes next is a lot of variations of what they want. Not of this text to calendar automation, but they want leads, right? We have some ideas for lead finding. For real estate, it is lead finding, I guess is one of the most profitable things, most in demand things. Some other updates. The email campaign for real estate is going. We just had two sessions with Nico to make sure that the messaging that we're putting out there is what we want to put out there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe talked about one resource to learn related to Langchain, related to Orag. We also talked about some tasks that we have for completing, for pushing knowledge now forward. Where we're at for the MVP of knowledgenow is from a human prompt and the global context knowledge base. We're going to transfer that information to the context enrichment agent whose job is to fix and enrich a prompt using what it has at its hand. The output is an enriched prompt. The objective optimizing prompt for rag querying. The input is an enriched prompt and the global context. The output are categories or topics of the prompt. Finally the answer agent we will put two in one for this MVP which is formatting the answer depending on the use case and we receive the enriched prompt global context and the evaluator output which is these reranked chunks and it outputs the final answer, formatted the answer that we're going for the MVP is Bartech. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI'm just now making commits to my branch with Xray agent and I make a little mess. There is few ideas where to take that further. I have a looks good version. I just baked that right now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWould you like to share screen and share with us? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, it's already on the GitHub, but I can walk you through. Here it is. All right. Can you see my screen? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, so I make a little mess over here in the raquery agent folder there is some curious pieces. This would be good to test whether we should add that or not. So let's just see how this one works. If it works fine, then fine, let's iterate later.Speaker 3\\nSo generally it takes the review the context in each prompt, highlight the key concepts, determine the approach for breaking down in the sub queries categorized by team relevance and stuff like that. Create sub queries for each category. Optimize semantic accuracy. It still should be added some those latent space activation somewhere around in here. But let's not overcomplicate for now. Like I wanted to just make draft. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nTotally. I love how you call it. Looks good. Yeah, it looks good, man. I really like that blue. Whatever vs code is doing there. That blue looks great. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThat's markdown formatting inside of vs code. That's why I'm using vs code for prompting because I can have more clarity and readability. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nWe won't go there. Yes, lane space activation will always obviously help while we optimize that. While we optimize that, I will get that vector database querying best practices knowledge base kind of for ourselves. Yeah, for the evaluator agents as well. Right? It's like, hey, these are some querying best practices help us evaluate the query and the answer. Given the knowledge base, what could better? Whatever. So we can implement that in different places. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, definitely. I was actually wondering about whether we go with the knowledge graphs, for example, because I've been digging into those materials on the weekend when I had a little time for that. And I mean, I didn't finish the whole course, but I just go through half of it. Oh, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm about to start it. Yeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe queries are quite different, I think, than usual. Querying of the pine cone, for example, whether we would have still those natural language queries in here. And in the knowledge graphs, you kind of have this querying, this cipher kind of thing. I don't know if you got into that yet or not. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNot that, but tell me more. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI mean, they got this cipher querying, sort of more programmatic querying than the natural language querying, I would say. And I was playing with it a little bit. But I just decided we probably go with pine cone first, and then maybe later we go with the knowledge graphs. So. Yeah, I prepared pine cone. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. It's funny how instinct we are again, yesterday, everybody was talking about knowledge graphs, and it seemed that one level up of preparation of the data, of maintenance of the knowledge graph, of the knowledge base, and of querying. So let's get there. Because the interesting thing about the graphs is that the meeting that we had on Thursday and the meeting that we're having right now are deeply related to each other. And those relationships are so much harder to grab only semantically, even when you look at dates and numbers. Right. It's just an LLM interpreting numbers, and we know how that goes. That's not what they do. They don't intuitively know that 27 follows 26. However, with knowledge graphs. Hey, March 27 followed the meeting that we had on March 26. So there's that continuity there. They're deeply related. Query those two documents. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf you query one, query the other kind of relationship, and that opens up so much potential. But it need not be what we implement first. In fact, it might not be the best idea to implement it first. When we're looking for performance and standing out in the market with performance, I would very much lean towards that. But hey, it's a developing field. We're still very early, and let's wait for people to do the things wrong so we can follow the best practices for now, as you said, let's continue with knowledge bases and vector databases. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYes. I also stumbled upon something I think could cause the problems we had last time, that there is, I don't know if there is some kind of built in LANC chain prompt to the retrieval, but I found, or maybe you guys just find the same thing I found. There is something like the query prompt is stating, I'm just sending it that in the discord. Like if there is not enough information, say I don't know. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSay I don't know. I saw that today. Oh my God. Yeah, I found it on my end too. The multi query notebook, one of the resources I sent, it also says that. And I was like, oh, that's where that came from. We should be able to modify that, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYep. I just don't know whether this is a prompt like Kuba put in the code, or it's just like some underlying length changing towards rug. I just dropped that in the discord right now. Okay, so there is also, the first link is for the rag Pinecon multi query something. So there is some documentation on the local host. I bet you got to have this up and running. So I didn't have time to check that out. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI missed you on that one. Would you say that one more time? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI mean, the first link is, I found some rack pine cone multi query thing in language documentation, so that may be worth to check out. It's having more details. You can see all templates at localhost docs. So I guess you get it up running on your computer and then you can check that out. So I didn't go as deep into that, but the thing I mentioned before for the I don't know thing is the order link and I passed the prompt they used. So I'm actually put that into PFA. So one of the prompts we have in the. I don't know which, but one of them should be from, I think the long one. Actually, this one should be from this. I mean, I put that into PFA, I don't know, prompt and say, expand it to our thing. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nImage of the figma. And there it go with creating. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, I'm checking out those resources now. Yes, the pine cone type query, the well, but that just kind of gives you the answers, right? Unique union. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I'm not sure whether we need that, but I thought maybe there is some programmatic layer to this, not only making AI generate multiple queries and running them one by one, maybe there is a way to have them all sort of launch asynchronously, like simultaneously in parallel. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI'm pretty sure that is a thing. Parallel vector database querying. I feel I remember seeing that. Where is the vector database parallel indexing, parallel processing, no, but that's not for the vector side. Yes, there we go. By leveraging parallel processing techniques, distributed vector databases can enhance query performance. Queries can be executed simultaneously on multiple nodes. Techniques such as parallel indexing, parallel query execution, or distributed computing frameworks can facilitate parallelism, parallel query execution and good call. Good call out. Okay, we'll also look into that. Let's get that agent up and running. The transcript which we're going to use this knowledge base are getting finished, so that will be just Kuba. If you can help with getting those process, I'll let you know when they're ready. Let's see. Okay, thank you Vartek. Thank you for sharing. Kuba. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDid you get a chance to jump into any resources and what tasks did you get to tackle? Hopefully the Internet issue didn't kill all of your opportunities for jumping into the Internet. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nNot really. Actually, I was really able to build out the context agents like using the rug, the knowledge bees as a tool, checking out other resources I was not able because the Internet was very bad. Now that he's welcome, I'm going to check the cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, they'll definitely help as we get deeper and deeper into rag. So could you show this global context document with the retrieval? Is that implemented yet? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBartek, could you stop sharing so he gets a chance? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAll right, I'm also drafting the evaluator agent altro. I think we will get clarity on what exactly evaluator agent should do a little bit later. We have run those context plus extractor agent pairs and have few test cases run through these, then see the output, then we'll iterate on evaluator agent and for now I just will put that into the repo as the first question. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. You're just missing an E in the faster ICE names up top. Gone through so many transcripts where faster ICE is just not written. Well, I've seen every possible variation. Let's see. Oh, sorry Kua, I stopped your sharing by mistake. Would you share again? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBoth agents are now on my branch. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. Awesome. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThe rack query is in the looks good folder and evaluator agent just have one prompt right now. It's like draft looks good because it's looking good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCan we love the looks good? Can we name them differently so we know where to look for each one as long as they have? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI will just create a test folder and I will put the ready prompts in the test folder. Ready to test. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nDo that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI will name it. Ready to test. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nReady to test. Cool. We'll have to figure out how we go about the testing. Okay. Yeah, so we're with you. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo after the splitting two chunks, creating the putting into pine con. So now I created it too. And this tool will be used. Use this tool where you're asking question about meetings, tax activities in an organization called fast Rise. Okay, so this is the prompt and this is the tool. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI got to check my hit shared button. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, I'm initializing the agents. So this is querying the agent. Let me run all, first of all. So I asked it what the buttex and alu discussing a meeting. So, but discuss the outcome of a developer meeting. The focus of ensuring clarity on tax related to a specific system. They are working on dimension brainstorming idea, potentially using the boats to measure messages and emphasis emphasize the importance of each team member understanding attacks within the system for success. The meeting was centered around planning and organizing the work to be done. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, this must have been the first knowledge now meeting, right? Yes. It didn't quite get the name. Yeah, sure. Keep going. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I just added memory so we can query multiple times. So it has memory of previous chart. So I asked what system were they working on. So it's not really. Patek and Aliyah were working on specific system, but the details of the system were not specified in the information provided of the exact system. So I said, can you list out the development tax discussed? So he said, ensuring clarity on which tax of the system they are going to tackle. Focusing on the subcomponent of the component. Setting up each team member for success in the project, restoring idea, creating more space measure success. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I think I've not really added the global context. Because of the Internet, I was not able to download anything. I thought it was so bad. Okay, I'm going to add it and I'm sure it's going to be much more better. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. Yeah. So with the context, this is a good sort of intuitive benchmark of where it's at. It knows of a system. It knows of a system that we're building on. It knows a development call. It knows, it knows. It taught certain phrases like setting up each team member for success, which we definitely emphasized on the subcomponents of the component. So whatever chunks it got, if we could print out the chunks that it gets at each step, or rather for the queries, I think that'd be really useful to figure out where is the fall off and what is the improvement once we make some changes like the better transcript and the global context. So that will be useful for logging. We have to figure out a way to get to more test driven development or mainly test driven development because this is intuitively. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOh, that's a good answer. That's a fine answer. It's just intuitive. Right. We need some data as we iterate. Would you show the outputs to bartech one more time? The ones on top. So this is for our first knowledge noun draft where we spend those 2 hours. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo I queried the agent after creating the knowledge and putting it into Pyco rather then based in pycon. So I created an agent. So I queried the agent and I asked what did Bartek and Alino discuss in the meeting? So this was the output. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo it interpreted that query asked meeting discussion between Bartek and that was okay. So that was the. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSaid Bartek and you discussed the outcome of a development meeting. They focused on ensuring clarity on tasks related to a specific system they are working on. They mentioned brainstorming idea, potentially using a bot to measure messages and emphasize the importance of each team member understanding the attacks within the system for success. The meeting was centered around playing and organizing the work to be done. Okay. So I created a memory for it so I can queries multiple. This is, I asked another question, another query. What system were they working on? Like I was asking from the previous conversation, I said Battek and Aliyo were working on a specific system, but the details of the system were not specified in the information provided. So it's still not like a way of some information. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo what's that first line? Because that seems like the conversation memory or discuss the outcome of a development meeting related to a specific system. So now the query that is being asked to the vector database is being sort of mixed with the conversation memory. Is that right? Yeah. So go show me the query in that cell right above. Yeah. What system were they working on? But now the knowledge base is being asked the query. Bartek and Alejo discussed the outcome of a development meeting related to a specific system they were working on. So what is it doing with that prompt exactly? Because I don't see though what system were they working on in there? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nYeah, that's the chat history. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay. So it's looking at the chat history and then it's asking what system were they working on? Yeah. Okay, cool. So it thinks that there is no specific name to the actual system. Okay, cool. We can the details of the system. We're not specifying the information provided. So that probably refers to maybe it's chunk size, probably chunk quality, maybe too much noise in the transcript. Okay. And then our actual MVP question, which is can you list out the development tasks discussed? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nThis was the output development tasks discussed in the meeting between BuTEC and you include ensuring clarity on which tasks of the system you are going to tackle, focusing on each of component of the component, setting up each team members of success in the project. Brainstorming idea to knowledge, creating more space using the bots to measure messages. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, measure message. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is way too generic. Like, if I wasn't on that meeting, I wouldn't know what the heck is going on. I only know because I was there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, because he literally helped build it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. Okay, are we using GPT 3.5 or GPT four? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n3.5 turbo. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, let me change it to. Yeah, let's change it to Ford Turbo and we'll rerun it and see if there's a lift there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. And are we using the context enrichment in here? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nNo, we're not yet. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nI told earlier about my Internet, so I'm going to try to fix that today. Like use the context enrichment from brother. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nFour turbo preview, I think. Let's see what happens. Okay, so you just have an ipy and B, I've been trying to get my vs code to look like that. And of course it can parse ipython notebook. Okay, cool. All these dumb things I'm still learning about. Yeah, I mean, good question. Right. Is it about interpretation of the information or the quality of the information being granted? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat query do you want to give it? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's do the same one so we can test against low. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nRight. I organize the folders, the prompts on the repo. Now there is like the ready to test folder and there is folders for each agent. They're just one prompt. That is the best prompt, as I see with my eyes. Without testing, the contact agent is kind of tested because I put that in the GPTs and I play around with it little. So this is in the prompt live folder as before. So the life is kind of ready more because it's already tested. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nPlease show us in a minute, because you're saying all these names that I'm not familiar with. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nMaybe I'll just screenshot that for later reference. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLength of the chunk is 166. Okay. We'd probably want to increase that, especially with the bigger model I've been reading about. Also, whatever chunk you take, whatever chunk is relevant, get the two chunks before and after. That could make sure that we don't miss valuable information. So that might be something to implement too. Tactics for rag get chunks. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nIssue with. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe API key again, yeah, I'm checking and I haven't gotten any notice. That one should be working. Weird though. Strange. Do you maybe rerun the whole no go one more time? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nCan you see if it's understandable? Now, in the discord, I make a screenshot with little exploration. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet me see. Thanks. Okay, so here's a new folder structure. Live means already tested in GPT's environment. Cool. Ready to test. I picked best version not tested yet. Okay, we have the context agent, the evaluator agent. Okay, I see what you're saying. So what if it was the other way around? What if there was the evaluator agent, the rack query agent, the context agent, and each of those was a folder that had prompts, live prompts, work in progress and ready to test. So then based on the agent, we can create evaluations and test new ones, replace old ones, stuff like that. Does that make sense? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWait, let me look into that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf this works for your logic. Now that is not the critical part, but just making sure that, for example, Kuba can always find latest version and stuff like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nIf you'll see in the prompt, work in progress. I have also like each agent has its own folder for the working files, so that's kind of better for me to work with it. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nAgent has more testing. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nProbably do another folder with a full, ready prompt, tested and stuff. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, sounds good. We can always refactor the structure. It's good. Whatever works for you now. It's good. As long as we can all find the prompt easily. As long as we can easily identify. Yes. This is the one we have to use for that agent. That's good. Yes. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nOkay, it's working now. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. What do you think was the issue? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSo the API key. So for the first query. Okay, so the API key, I need to fix it every time. Okay, so you say now, in the meeting between Alu and along with Kuba, the discussion appeared to be a casual catch up section, rather than focusing on specific topic or agenda. Initially, there were some issues with alio connection, which were resolved by him deciding not to use edge. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBro, are you kidding me? \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nVata mentioned that he had just eaten immortality, confusing dinner with lunch accidentally, how he was doing. The overall tone of discussion was informal, friendly, and primarily centered on checking each other. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we know how to fix that and I'll take responsibility for that, which is cleaning the freaking transcript, because that is ridiculous. That is ridiculous. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is about me eating. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, this is about you confusing dinner and lunch. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nOh my God. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight? Yeah, we just got the first chunk. Let's see, we're going to have to create a bit of maybe even thread in the knowledge now discord channel to have tactics for rag because it's probably a good idea to make sure that we're being. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nChunks. Summarization, like a semantic summarization. Or maybe use the SPR for each chunk. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSPR for each chunk. See, there are a lot of times where we need a step by step. I just don't want to compress too much too early. And our evaluator and sort of merger agents are already going to go with compressing. I've been thinking about SPR. I don't think we should leave it out. I'm worried about compressing too early, maybe making chunks bigger, but I don't know. I'm going to write it down and we'll get around to trying it. Bartech spr chunk size overlap size. Okay, if we could have a rag agent, if we could have a rag GPT to help us figure out optimal situations for optimal setup for the type of data that we're working with and the type of project that we're working with, that would be really interesting, like hyperparameter tuning. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nGuys, this question was actually answered properly. The question was, sorry, I didn't notice a system. There was system all right, because I just read that. What were Barte, Caleb and Cuba discussing? Yeah, we basically discussed that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, right. We updated that in the beginning. Yeah. I wonder if it's a lost in the middle situation. But okay, no specific development task. Come on, man. Okay, so Kuba, number one for debugging. If we could get chunks retrieved, that would be great. So we can actually figure out where the root cause of this is, regardless of if we have global context. Right. If it's not retrieving the right thing, then we're in trouble. So just to make it clear, none of these criticisms are on you. We're developing an imperfect system together. We're exploring an imperfect system together, built on imperfect building blocks. Langchain still very much on development rag, still very much a field of research. So this is awesome progress. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's get that global context document in there and let's get some debugging prints so we can all go along, provide suggestions, and keep iterating day by day. I will also write this down and send it your way while we are setting up this system to do it for me. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nAll right, cool. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, thank you for sharing. Get, find out which resource you want to dig into. Maybe it's multi query, maybe it's something else. There are a few out there that are really interesting that I shared. And maybe it's in the handbook, in the Lang chain handbook. Maybe even find a chapter that resonates with what you're dealing with now because, you know, a lot of the tools, I'm seeing new tools that you're implementing, and that's really cool how you're going about creating tools. So I'm sure there's a chapter in there that will help you kind of level up day by day. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, one more thing I'm going to share, and we'll call it my exploration for all this rack stuff began today, and I grabbed this multi query notebook and I started going line by line, cloning it line by line, command CV as little as possible. And just like literally writing it out, which I noticed, even if I'm changing tabs and just writing the same words, I'm seeing much better way of imprinting it into my mind. So I'm only like a quarter of the way through. But I set up a vector database programmatically, which I hadn't done before, and uploaded the document. So that was fun. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nBut that's not, you know, what's the joke of the best way to remember code? Pen and paper. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThat is totally true. I guess that's why there were so many pen and paper exams during my computer science degree. We were all pissed at that because it's like, are you kidding me? Are you actually kidding? We're writing computer code in piece of paper with pen. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, but it's actually good. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou're wrong, because I don't remember any of it. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nWhen I was starting out to learn flutter, I had trouble to remember the code and I just was writing it in the paper until I remembered it. Like a muscle memory, it's kind of different use of hand, but still your brain remembers. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIt's literally that. It's literally muscle memory. Dead on. I want to make sure that we can all see what this will look like from here to Friday. So, no, there's some stuff that we have to get done, but we are making progress, you guys. So MVP. Ready? Going backwards. We're going to need to figure out a way to evaluate. So figure out evaluation metrics. The evaluator age we talked about. Hey, these were the queries that were given. These were the results. Re rank them. But there's something missing there. It's the what could have been better? What could have been better? I'm not just writing as a question. We'll figure out what it looks like in code. Essentially, what queries could have been better. And maybe that's the V two. Maybe that's the QA agent that is in charge of that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nBut yeah, make knowledge base with cleaned transcripts. Then going backwards for the rag extractor agent, we're putting in some subtasks we might want a best practices doc to go off of. Not essential for the first test, but definitely we want to create some standard. And for the PFA context enrichment agent, we have the global context document, so it can feed off of that. What tasks are here, that what tasks aren't here? What am I missing here? What do we need to make this system better? For the MVP tactic, E. G. There's get chunks, get previous, and after get previous and following chunk play with chunk size. You said there was research on essentially hyperparameter optimization for this vortex. Did I misunderstand once again? Yeah. Did you mention there was some research on, hey, what would be the ideal chunk size for your application? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think there was something about prompts that the prompts ideally should be like 256, 512, 1024, something like that. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThe prompts themselves. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I remember Spencer talking about this in those early workshops and lions accelerator. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nThis is because the chunks of the training data that OpenAI was feeding the hrgpt. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo are you talking about the encoding into the embeddings, the vectors being of size, like 1536, et cetera? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, like 512. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nSo we should be good, because, Kuba, I see that you're using the text embedding of GBT three large. Even if you use the small, your application might be faster. And those should be at 1536. But let's get that verified. Vector sizing consistent with, obviously the model that we're using for the GBT with model and across essentially branches, that we're all using the same exercise. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAnd I think we are already multi querying. So now we already have the COVID like multi querying and then assessing the best chunks. We have that in those later agents, right? \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nRight, yes. Rag extractor and evaluator, is that what you meant? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, I think we had some in the big picture. We had those later agents, like not for MVP, that were focusing on choosing the best pieces. One, I think it's after supervisor. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nOkay, the merger. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah, this one. It's crucial that what you said before, to print the chunks so we can actually see how many, for example, is retrieved and what is. And this will be crucial for developing later agents. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, it's a little tricky. We have a transcript, right? So at the start of each person speaking says like a speaker, and even if it's, I read even if it's like speaker one, speaker two, speaker three, and no names, that really helps with performance. So that's part of what I'm working on. So the chunks are just like this is where it gets cut off. So if it's in the middle of a paragraph and that's the chunk that gets retrieved, there's no information or coherence with who is saying it. That feels uneasy with me given the structure of our data. So maybe it's more overlap, maybe it's bigger chunk size with more overlap to make sure that we're getting those speaker names or speaker tags in there. Yeah, there's a million things we can do. So this, let's get this MVP by Friday. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nLet's get something that we can see the whole pipeline through and we can start taking steps back and identifying the critical points of failure. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nCool. But yes, good call out on this. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI think we should have some test iteration pipeline. Whether Kuba is running the code, seeing the outputs, let's share that somewhere. I don't know. Maybe airtable, maybe screenshots in some channel of discord. We would separate for that. Yeah, very helpful. Iterating on the prompts, seeing actual outputs. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nI agree. I very much agree. Good call out. I've been getting friendlier with airtable and it feels like at the very least we can start there and we can get more sophisticated, but a place we can even just see collect. I'll try to create a module from airtable sometime this week to just, hey, here's the table name, just put it in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nAlso automate that. Add a function to every agent that after outputting the message, send that through API to airtable. And then we could have like this agent said this, this were the inputs and stuff that would be automatically covered. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThen let me share what I did here. Maybe it's something like this. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n1 second. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYep. \\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nSorry guys, my batteries will. I'll catch up with the record. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYes, 1 second. I just wanted to show you, we're going to put the prompts in airtable and the results in something like this where we can say, hey, here's the agent, here's the prompt, here are the results, or here are the chunks printed. We're going to have something like this and we can actually keep track. If we're going to not keep it super programmatic, then at least let's add the systematic aspect and we'll figure out LLM evaluation, which is always still very much the more lagging field of research. Thank you, Kuba. Thank you, Bartech. I'll write down fear to do, and we can move forward. Any questions? What questions can answer? \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nI don't think so. I think we have clearly laid out what are the next steps? We need some more debugging. We need some more control over testing, and that's it, basically, where we'll go from there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah. I think we're in a good place, guys. I think we're moving forward. So let's bang the next agent out. I'll make sure you guys have the resources that you need, including the context, the transcripts, and we got this. The end line of the MVP is insight. So let's keep going. \\n\\nSpeaker 3\\nYeah. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nThank you all. \", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\processed\\\\transcripts\\\\2024-03-18 Dev Meeting - KnowledgeNow MVP steps, Kuba output reviewcleaned.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Speaker 1\\nToday I'm speed running through making multi queries for rag on Langchain. We're going to start quite simple, following the tutorial. For installs, we're using pine cone, langchain data sets, OpenAI, and tick token using the AI archive. For the document prep, we'll set up the documents data. Each doc is an object of type document with the page content being the chunk and the metadata being the title, source ID, Chunk ID, and then the actual chunk text.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nEmbedding vector data and setting up a vector database is next. Then we're going to have a query with lang chain, which is starting with the structure. Adding the generation rag, we build a multi-power retrieval augmentation chain. Training everything with a sequential training case. Then custom multi-query there. Throwaway key and we're playing with embeddings. Model name is Ada text embedding data two model name. For the serverless spec, it's going to be equal to serverless spec in there. \\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nIf the index name is not in existing indexes, we create the index. The index name will have dimensions equal to the ADA two dimensions, which is 1536 metric. Dot product spec is going to be equal to spec while the index name status is not ready, we wait.
