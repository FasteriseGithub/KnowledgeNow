Speaker 2
Yes, were in a place that looked like this doing a lot of work, but it was a mixture of a one day workshop for educators and youth workers. We also did training for facilitation. So like public speaking skills, learning how to deliver the curriculum, and then we had a five day youth program, all middle school students who were a handful. Really good program, really cool, a lot of work, a lot of energy, and full on, but very rewarding.

Speaker 1
That's interesting because I actually networked yesterday with a lady, that organizing event at the college in Warsaw, and they're basically looking for people that do AI and want to be speakers on such a thing. And it's directed actually to the high school graduates of this year that want to know interested in AI and want to basically find the path in the space.

Speaker 2
You know, looking for doors like that, where we can step in and maybe there are people on site that can do it. But actually, one of the talks that Alejo did during the program was not specifically about AI, but about our relationship with technology. And it was woven together within theme of balance. So how do we find balance in our lives, especially with technology playing such a big role.

Speaker 2
Otherwise, this particular program is aimed to be as technology free as we can to facilitate kind of a disruption in their lives of, okay, we're pause. We're going to be face to face with each other. But it would be super awesome to find sort of like a tech ed oriented foundation organization that would be able to donate either, like, chat GBT subscriptions or iPads or computers where we could host workshops on building a project with Chat GBT.

Speaker 1
That is that we're doing a deck for our clients is Pablo.

Speaker 3
I got a hit of inspiration when we came back late at night, and I just started coding, man. It was impressive.

Speaker 1
Yeah. I was thinking actually yesterday about using some of these code assistants to assist in writing prompts, but I was thinking, what if I would connect PFA to code assistant. And let's talk about what we have right now. So, circling back to the content and to the video, have you had time, Paige, to continue the editing?

Speaker 2
I went through some trial and error with this video editing. A few different softwares. But I found this new tool called Opus Pro that I just dropped this video in. It's going to upload for about three minutes and we're going to see what kind of shorts it spits out. So it basically takes the large video file and make auto generate.

Speaker 1
Oh, I'm still working on this kind of mention form. It's going very slowly. I need to really focus on that. I cannot have any disruptions.

Speaker 1
I've been trying before. I decided that, now the swarm is the only way to go. I was trying also to fix the UX of the version that is currently live.

Speaker 2
So what are your thoughts on bringing PFA to market? How are you envisioning? What ideas do you have about how to productize it?

Speaker 1
Actually, I've been thinking about giving a PFA light version, let's say PFA overseer, for example. The main idea was to give a PFA light version for free, or maybe some other version that would be like. Or maybe if we have the swarm. But the kind of swarm is tricky, because if we just give half of the process, it won't work so good.

Speaker 2
The paid version would include the swarm, you would get limited access to the non-paid version that you could use and then upgrade to the full version, which would include the swarm.

Speaker 1
Or I have also one idea, but that would be even more work because we could actually have the swarm, the GPT swarm for free, and then also build the same thing in code where it would be basically automatically going from one agent to another. But yeah, this is conceptualization, kind of, I'm not sure yet, but definitely we can try sort of circling back to my development process and let's say like the overseer version is the current version and just give it out for free and start the conversation going. And then on the back end, I was working on the PFA swarm in the meantime.Speaker 5
Yeah. May I ask, did you maybe mention about also for the corporate world that we've been discussing about giving the PFA as a part of a bigger solution in terms of AI adoption? Have you been mentioning about it already? 

Speaker 1
We discussed that little bit along the PFA school, but yeah, we could bring that up again. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, it kind of came up after Alejo and I went to this workshop with people in the real estate industry as, hey, we could offer essentially a consultation, like a 90 minutes consultation. The number we put on it was 600. That would include we sit down with you one one, we build a chat GPT based flow or solution, which is not something that, it's something that they could do, but it just might take them hours to figure out how to do it. It would include access to PFA, maybe the PFA light version, maybe a three month subscription to the PFA, and then we would follow up, based on this consultation and the information that we've gathered from the meeting, and recommend two or three bigger system integration solutions that we see could benefit their business. 

Speaker 2
That would obviously be bigger paid solutions, because some of the outside of this bubble, number one, these people think they're first, they think they're the first people to know about AI and chat GPT, and they don't even have time to learn prompting. They don't have time for this. They're willing to pay people to help them. Some of them might like. A lot of people in real estate are more or less freelancers. They're going out, they're getting their own leads, they're associated with an agency, but their business is their responsibility. That's kind of a thought that we've had around PFA as a way to offer and get it out there. In sort of like an initial subscription. If people sign up for the consultation, and then the other kicker would be you pay the 600 or whatever number that might be for the consultation. 

Speaker 2
If you choose and implement a larger scale project with us, then the $600 would go towards it. 

Speaker 5
I personally love the idea and how you sell it. Not sure, but if you have anything to comment, just jump in, because I'm just on the verge of starting to chalk and chalk, because I feel so inspired now. 

Speaker 3
In that case, let me add a couple of things. Yeah, Paige got it just right. There's a plan for consultations. 

Speaker 2
I'm listening. I'm just letting the dog out, but I'm here. 

Speaker 3
That's a plan for consultations. I just wrote it in the chat. It includes access to PFA. That's obviously where a royalty obviously comes in. We're selling your products and part of the consultation fee goes your guys'way in. The 75, 90 minutes as we're sitting out with them is an audit. It's an AI audit. And part of it is like what we noticed is that they need something tangible. The people that are starting to get into AI are overwhelmed by, number one, the amount of tools that they're not even processing, what the tools are for, or how they could help their business. That's number one. And number two, no clear action plan for creating new tools. But does a real estate agent really need a clear action plan for how to create GPTs? They will tell you probably not. And the reality is they do. 

Speaker 3
But is that the first step? Well, with PFA, number three is actually creating two GPTs with them sitting down next to them. And it's like you write it, I'll just guide you with the how. And PFA is a great way to speed that up. I love it and I want to now transition to a different dimension of answering your question. If I heard correctly, PFA for corporate PFA as an instrument in, say, the corporate world, I very much still believe that PFA is something that you can sell at a very high price because of the extremely high value. That high price comes with the assumption that this productionized version works very reliably and that it goes through the complex process of itself. For example, the multi agent swarm, that it goes through those eight agents, and it just shows you the output. 

Speaker 3
It might take a while, of course, and that's obviously where the user testing comes in. So to answer your question, I think there's testing that needs to happen with the latest versions, not with the version from two months ago, because that's not the one that is valuable testing for. So finding key, influential people, giving access to the latest version of PFA, and not just the latest version, because it was the last one that was made, but an actual extremely effective one. And as effective as PFA is, the agents might be even more effective. So say whatever version you settle on is a good time spent, a good ROI, a good return on investment of the time you would have to spend for the next version. Make a decision on that and find those people and grant access. 

Speaker 3
But hey, we'll give you free access to this means nothing. Probably has negative value in the eyes of a corporate executive. So we have to find the way around. Maybe it's through an online conference, maybe it's through a webinar that we're selecting certain people so you can apply here. And whatever, it has to be strategic. It can't just be, hey, this is $2,000, but it also can't be like, hey, help us test this. There's a lot of value in this. There's a channel through which we show the value, for example, live webinar, and then we're selecting certain people to help them multiply their productivity. With this tool, you could be one of those. This is the characteristics of those people. Do you work for a corporation and are you an executive of the corporation? Whatever other requirements, then you're allowed to apply. 

Speaker 3
That's how I would picture it. From there. It's up from there. As long as you get these influential people to use it, to test it, and then give you feedback, then you have a final version and you have the testimonies from corporate executives. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, sounds great. I'm not sure if I jump in with a couple of questions regarding your conversations with real estate, and then I will move to what you have already said. Okay, first of all, great to see you guys. Sorry that I had to be a little bit late. I really rushed to follow up to the prospect client. And actually, you see the name of the prospect client. Just to mention we are in kind of early talks with a huge game developer. They're called huge games. They are polish american company. They're mostly based in Poland, but also have offices in the US and some development teams in the US, in Israel, and a couple of different countries as well. Around 400 500 game developer employees. 

Speaker 5
And we are going to be checking whether are we a good partner for them, because they have already started and they have some vendors in their AI roadmap. So it's like I was a little bit surprised that they have signed off on some contracts already, but maybe there's still a room for us. But what we have been checking with them is what you see at this moment on the screen. And you have already saw for a moment, probably maybe once or twice, this diagram, and it perfectly aligns with what you have just presented, and we call it as a part of our AI adoption package. So the idea is that the employees, whether it's a corporate or maybe a mid sized company or whatever, the corporate people, the adoption, we see that the adoption is not huge. 

Speaker 5
And it's quite similar with, as you were referring to your people that you spoke in real estate, sometimes they just don't know where touch, how to start. They are not even thinking about prompt engineering on how to prompt. They just don't know. You have to get their hand and kind of guide them step by step. And this is the case with pre use. This huge games company, the huge games company have created a bot that they have integrated in their slack. Each employee has access to their slack and they have just built a slack bot that is connected to OpenAI APIs, to cloud, to some different language models. 

Speaker 5
But instead of getting the user experience that pure vanilla GPT gives you, that you have those four boxes with the example questions that you have some intro description of what you can ask by the GPT, what GPT does exactly. So the user experience actually is much poorer than you get from the typical pure vanilla GPT. Because I saw by a life example that an employee gets this phone gets to the slack, entered the slack bot, and he says me that I don't know what to do. The problem is, I don't know what I can ask. This guy actually is in HR. He works in the area called compensation benefits and he has like years of experience and he knows how to do his job. 

Speaker 5
And now he gets a tool that somebody said that hey, this will improve your work, but I know how to do my work and now I have to think. First I need to think like what I can get and how should I ask the question and what to ask about. So we need to guide them, take them by hand and guide them. And also were thinking about creating, or that's what were actually testing on those sales calls or intro calls that each of these employees going to have, or each department going to have the possibility to create those very specialized agents or assistants, we haven't decided yet how to call them for assisting with particular jobs. In this example that we already actually created for the edtech company in the US. 

Speaker 5
So it's maybe not exactly relevant, but very often you either work with kind of an assistant or a thought partner, sometimes called strategist role or a creator role. Know, for example, summarize me this text or create me content for my strategic deck for the meeting with the board. So this is the creator role. The thought partner is just to idealize and ask for feedback or critique. So those are three example roles. And then we ideated that on the end of this user path there is PFA. So whenever you can't work with the predefined by your department or predefined by your company, whenever the standard assistants that are out there are not good enough, you can create your own. And that aligns exactly with what you have just told me. Like what you visualize the possibility to use the PFA after your conversations. 

Speaker 5
Did I got it right? I think that we have just both you with your market, with your conversations. We have already also been thinking and trying to get to the go to market strategy with PFA. I think that we are starting to align again. Did I got it right? 

Speaker 3
What a surprise. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
It sounds like. 

Speaker 3
I think a different dimension of the same thing that we're talking about. This is, I think a good visual example of the implementation, but it is complementary to the actual. Like how would we promote it, bring awareness to it? And this would be pretty complementary. This is something we would show at, for example, the live webinar. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, I fully get it and I love the idea that you have just presented, let's say in live webinars. To expand on this idea, how to bring into those company, whether there's a real estate company or a different one, we would need to communicate openly in a similar way that I have just done it and address or maybe verify. Ask whether they have this problem that we often observe with our clients that the AI adoption is pretty low very often, and that this is the way that they might approach this. Assuming that they already are convinced that there is a sense to go with AI tools, that there is a sense that we don't need to convince them about the AI automation idea. In general, I assume that the business people are already aware of the possible benefits going with AI automation implementation. 

Speaker 5
It's just the thing that they are worried that they maybe have some already tools that are implemented or they are planning or they don't know how to do it to have this AI adoption on a pretty high level. So yeah, I think that we are onto something. I love it and I would love to ask you more about what hours have you got from those conversations? Not hours, but let's go deeper in terms of those real estate agents. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, let's step into that in a second. Paige, by any chance that video finished uploading? Yeah, man, I'll let Paige take it. But I want you guys to picture content to strengthen branding, which leads to invitation to a live virtual event. This is the first step content. And this is about PFA. 

Speaker 2
So let's see. I think I haven't gotten a chance to watch any of these yet. 

Speaker 1
From my standpoint, when I'm making a project now, I'm just brainstorming with PFA and at the end it gives me a prompt and it lasts, I don't know, 15 minutes or even less maybe sometimes. Depends on how much I want to iterate it, because best working with it is actually when you give some feedback and you should really know what you want to do. Like in the first iteration, you can just say whatever and then it will brainstorm, it will give you some ideas, but after the first prompt, you need to give it some thought. Maybe try running somewhere, make a GPT out of it and just try running and see what outputs are like basic testing of the prompt. And then you can, for example, do. 

Speaker 3
Kind of a couple of others. PFA example. Yeah, these are all created on the fly from one big video. 

Speaker 2
So let's see. Tips and tricks for success. 

Speaker 1
Sometimes even I see still, I mean, this version is actually very good for my opinion, but sometimes it malfunctions a little bit because there is so many steps in it. There's actually like three distinct phases that need to be launched and then they have little steps inside and sometimes some parts get lost even though I make it. 

Speaker 2
So I can also update the size of the video frame to kind of match the platform that it's. A lot of people either have heard of it or maybe don't know what. 

Speaker 1
It is, and then AI is supposed to do something or produce something for you. 

Speaker 2
That was an interesting. 

Speaker 1
If you order, for example, if you want to search the web, you can do it with chat GPT, but it's. 

Speaker 5
Still not the same. 

Speaker 2
I would recommend that Google searching infused with AI. So what would I use chat GPT for? What can chat GPT? 

Speaker 1
And with what you want to introduce today, you can just, can you pause for a second? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, editable number one, for sure. Number two, the core video has a lot to do with the output, of course. 

Speaker 5
So. 

Speaker 3
This is one good example of, let's say we record the next video, a simplified one say 15 minutes of a demo, and we show, and through those 15 minutes, we can publish the 15 minutes video, and we can create some good videos out of some good short, four or five shorts out of that longer video. So now we have five, six things to publish, five shorts that usually get a lot of use, and the longer video, which is, hey, if you're interested, here's the whole thing, and this is one. So through one video, 15 minutes, solid demo, planned demo. Maybe not necessarily a script, but pointers that we need touch on. We create a content schedule, probably for the whole week. 

Speaker 3
What that steps into after maybe two or three, maybe the other two are other demos, maybe it's quick tips and tricks, whatever it might be. We start generating the audience, and through that would lead to, hey, we're doing this live event. We tried Opus pro for one of our videos, and it was actually pretty solid. So I wonder what is the difference and what we can change about the core initial video that would make these results even better. 

Speaker 5
Sorry, which one is the number one? 

Speaker 1
We should cut the beginning, definitely, because we started the actual video after I said, and then also after the kind of the part that's supposed to be recording. We also had a little conversation later, like 30 minutes. It's just our conversation at the end. So just cut that middle part where it's supposed to be the actual recording. And I think we will get much better results from that. 

Speaker 3
Oh, we should do that one. 

Speaker 1
Oh, changing. 

Speaker 2
That's awesome. 

Speaker 3
Cutting the initial video, cutting the parts that don't belong from the initial video and then uploading. That's probably a good idea. But I guess what I'm saying is, let's record. I really like the video shorter. 15 minutes, for example. 

Speaker 2
Right? 

Speaker 3
Go straight into value, and it's like demo. Another thing that has come up a lot is show not tell. We can talk about PFA, or you can code that project in 15 minutes that you were just talking about. In 15 minutes or less. I can do the brainstorming and we can have the prompt, and then I have the GPT. I test the GPT, and that's the whole video, and that's 15 minutes. And we make shorts out of that. 

Speaker 1
Interesting chats or any. 

Speaker 3
I was like, where did I come from? 

Speaker 1
And I will examine that and maybe find a way to fix. Maybe I will send how to teach. 

Speaker 2
Effectively without sacrificing sleep. Bartek's method reveal. 

Speaker 3
Oh my God, you're talking about. 

Speaker 4
You're talking about teaching two months from now without sleep. 

Speaker 1
You're not going to be able to. I slept 8 hours yesterday. I was talking pages in a row. 

Speaker 3
I love that this is documented. 

Speaker 5
I did. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. I think for this video in particular I could probably throw it. Well, I was just having. Maybe it'll export now to final cut pro. I can try to put it in fire cut to get all the silent spaces out because there are a bit of silent space as we kind of set up and transition. And then I can see what happens if I throw it in here. 

Speaker 3
Oh, that's a great idea. 

Speaker 2
At the very least these are all editable and much easier to edit in 52nd chunks versus the whole hour and however long this was. An hour and a half almost, I think. 

Speaker 1
But I think the actual content is like 50 minutes. 

Speaker 2
So this one we could cut out the first part because it kind of switches topics and doesn't really flow, but. 

Speaker 3
Just. 

Speaker 1
Was kind of good in the, how to say meritoric, kind of meritorious. How to say in English. 

Speaker 3
You mean the content? 

Speaker 5
There's no direct translation for the word. 

Speaker 1
I'll take that in Google. 

Speaker 5
That'S going to be published on fasterized channel. I'm thinking, are we able to craft kind of a targeting? How's it? 

Speaker 3
Well, can we optimize the targeting? 

Speaker 5
Can we optimize the targeting of the video? 

Speaker 3
Three factors. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Targeting is harder. You can use some keywords in your description, in your video file title. There's some tricks. So the answer is yes. Can you target executives without paying for ads? The answer is no. However, you could pay for ads. Well, we could put this in LinkedIn and target with this video. The answer is yes, but it would cost to target. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
The other thing you can do, every time when I upload the video, it processes the video and then I can click to generate the clips from it and it asks me a few prompting questions about what I'm using it for. So I can have that little bit of targeting in there. I don't know how pinpointing it is, but it does have that in here. 

Speaker 3
Oh, that's wonderful. That's perfect. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. So I think I put like the target was education for this. We could try it again with a different target and it might craft the messages a little bit differently. As we're making the video, we can kind of outsmart the AI a little bit and saying, okay, every new topic that we are going for, let's talk about La so that it starts there or like kind of name the topic in our conversation as we go, knowing that it's going to extract that and be able to identify topics or themes that will then create these clips from. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, that's great work and great tips that you are giving us that you have come up with. I'm very excited. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
For Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram, these reels are going to be perfectly lined. I'm thinking about LinkedIn as I haven't yet personally, I haven't seen anybody put anything like that on LinkedIn, so that would be quite of an experiment. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, for sure. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. We would need to check how it works. 

Speaker 3
But we're not posting a 15 minutes video. We're posting a 42nd video. And is LinkedIn not ready for 42nd reels? Is LinkedIn audience not wanting 42nd videos or has it just not been discovered or experimented with by the audience in LinkedIn? 

Speaker 5
Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 3
All the metrics show that videos less than 1 minute are attractive to people, dense the information and show it to them visually and auditorially in 45 seconds. That's something that you want. So I feel good about maybe putting some of the LinkedIn credits that we have, say $100 in total. $100 in total of LinkedIn credits in preparation for the live event. For the live virtual event through these videos. Maybe there's some posts, maybe there's a graphic, but these could be, hey, we're doing an event for this and that. And that's the ad. And the ad also shows this video. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, there are a few. Yeah, I think there are a few editing things we could do to maybe make them look a little more linkedinish as well. Yeah, but people. Yeah, I don't know that it would be a negative thing to post on LinkedIn, but thing to beta test for sure. 

Speaker 3
LinkedIn users phone versus desktop, because if it's phone mobile, 58%, it's our game. Let's go. 58% are users on the phone and they're already used to the videos on the phone. The shorts. 

Speaker 2
Right. 

Speaker 3
Okay, cool. Could you go to edit? Could you click on edit? I wonder what it actually allows you to edit. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, so you can. 

Speaker 3
Oh, let's fucking go. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, you can edit it in here. Change the layout for each scene manually. Just frame. Cool. Filler words and pauses. There we go. 

Speaker 3
I'm so excited. 

Speaker 2
And then you can turn the captions on or off. It's interesting. Now when you see this caption, to me, it's very. I've seen it before, everyone. It's like, oh, now I see. Now we know where people are making their shorts, but we can update it, right? We can make the captions different. 

Speaker 3
Did you click on fillers and pauses. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. Remove filler words. Okay. 

Speaker 3
So it didn't do it automatically. 

Speaker 2
Right. 

Speaker 3
Okay, cool. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. And then the other thing that you can do is if I go, let's preset template, edit brand template, because I posted one of these on the faster eyes Instagram and I put it in canva to do this. But we can upload, like, we can put our colors in whatever colors, upload the logo so that it automatically puts the logo somewhere on the video. I don't have to take it out anywhere for it to do that. And then we can save the brand. So there's some preset templates here if I want to have my TikTok reels and shorts, landscape and then square. So I think I was telling you about these, Alejo, this is what I was talking about with just like, the frame sizing for different platforms. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
It's even that square goes well with LinkedIn, as you can see. Yeah. And because of the coloring and the branding staff and the different layouts and styles, I think that we can make whenever we want to go with Instagram or YouTube shots, we can go with the standard thing that people are used to in terms of the styling of the fonts. But as you mentioned, LinkedIn, we could try to make a kind of a more grown up style, a little bit more professional looking and a little bit custom for LinkedIn platforms, for LinkedIn ish, as you mentioned. And that might work really great. 

Speaker 1
I really. 

Speaker 5
Excited. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, it's simple. But even just knowing that you don't have the phone view if you're looking at LinkedIn on a web page makes it that much more meant to be there versus a real posted on. This is. I'm excited for this. And we've talked about doing weekly podcast hours with various members of faster eyes. Bring in syllabus, talk about what we're doing. Maybe there's an emergent theme going on in the AI community. Stop share because my screen is getting a little fuzzy, and then throw it all in here and start posting videos, sharing our story. We can get shorts out of it for longer podcast hours that go really well. And we have great conversations. Let's post them. 

Speaker 1
Right? 

Speaker 5
Let's go. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, I've been watching Gary Vee lately, and also there is a team going on that there is a Facebook actually trending for marketing for social media this year. Like Facebook is coming back. We need a fan page in there for both fasterizing celebrities and posting also on Facebook. 

Speaker 3
Well, bigger, because real estate agents are on Facebook and Instagram. Instagram is more for the business, but the age range of real estate agents are on Facebook, which is usually 35 and up. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. And also there is one more thing regarding the long form content we want to put out. Gary V actually said the best to just start streaming. Like, live streaming. Like, literally just sit at your desk when you want to work and just open the camera. Don't give a fuck that it's like three people watching. Just say like, hi, he'll make a joke out of it. You need to watch the conference to. 

Speaker 5
Know the full picture. 

Speaker 1
But basically he tell that just put out any content, just show you working. So we could even, maybe not all the calls, but when we have calls, development calls or something, or sales calls, just put that out. 

Speaker 2
Live stream, build in public. 

Speaker 3
That's exactly what I was thinking about. Live stream, building public. Yo, yo. 

Speaker 1
And actually, the best thing is we actually have the recordings already. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, we already have the fucking recordings. Which is a big question because we have so many recordings. Yeah, I found something tragic the other day, which is in most of the recordings, my face doesn't show up in like 90 something percent of all the recordings that we have. I just don't show up because of my Zoom settings, which is fine. And it's just more encouragement to level it up. Have like a day of the week where we get together on a certain project to build in public. For example, these couple of projects. Simple projects, but straightforward, but we have to find our way around it. We could totally be recording those, building them together in public, or at least designing them in public. And they're straightforward and we're not even really selling them. 

Speaker 3
But it does show how we think about these projects, how we design and how we implement, and that we can. And those could be live streams. Those could be live streams. Let's simplify, though. Let's. Let's simplify. And live stream is a good way to simplify because you're not editing, because you're just doing the thing and it's productive because you're actually doing the work. And you don't get much luxury to get distracted during a live stream because the show has to go on anyway. Real estate, thank you for all your input on this. This is going to be huge for our marketing strategy, which is mostly just solely based on video. So this is going to be huge. Thank you all. Thank you, Paige. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, thanks. A real estate. 

Speaker 3
We met up with Paige's cousin, a mortgage lender who has a pretty big team. Real estate is all about relationships and they are very well positioned in terms of their network. So let me throw you a summary and then we can dig into the details. As of yesterday, the status is what we want out of the start of this relationship is referrals. So we are building two simple automations for free. We are building a text to Google calendar appointment setter. This is not a chat bot, this is just, hey, the message says, let's meet at 03:00 p.m. At this place. And that would trigger creating Google calendar events. And number two is within their CRM, creating something called action plans, which is if there's a new prospect, do this and then do that. A sequence, a CRM, normal CRM sequence. 

Speaker 3
Those are the two things that we're implementing in the coming week. They're straightforward. The documentation of the CRM is very good. Anyway, that is not the summary. That isn't the nitty gritty. Sorry. So two automations for free. She's more than willing to give us referrals, but it's not that she agreed to give us referrals. It's not like we had to convince her that giving us referrals would be good for our business. So we can trade well, do a good trade with each other. It's that she wants us to implement these things. For who? For her network, for the real estate agents that she works with. Because if they're more productive, everybody makes more money. So we found a perfect first client. So even just these two first automations might be automations. We sell down the line to the referrals. What other points are important? 

Speaker 3
We're meeting up with her and her core team. There's four of them next week to dig deeper, and we're also bringing a plan. So on Monday we're meeting with advocates, on Tuesday we have a Gen XeC meeting and this is up to change. But Paige and I initially talked about what the times would be, and then Wednesday we would meet with her team to talk like, hey, this is the plan. And part of the advocates in Gen XEC is to figure out, okay, how do we solidify this, actually making a contract, bringing a contract, that's one thing for automations, past the second one, and we have a whole list that they want to implement. We're going to be charging per delivery and we're going to talk more about this during advocates in Genxec. We're going to charge per product delivered and a retainer. 

Speaker 3
The retainer and the value of the retainer is her intent of implementing AI in all different parts of her business, including social media, and she has a social media person, but that social media person doesn't know the tools they could use. So the retainer is more on the education side. It's more on the helping her whole team adapt to 2024 and making productivity out of every area of her business. So I'm going to show you something to make it a little more visual because words are very abstract, and ask us any questions you may have. These are the. 

Speaker 5
How many employees? Sorry for interrupting. How many employees does she employ? 

Speaker 3
About 40. Is that right? 

Speaker 2
Well, she doesn't really employ. 

Speaker 3
Yes. Right. 

Speaker 2
Others. What we've learned is that mortgage lenders need relationships with realtors because that's where they get a lot of leads for their business. It's her childhood best friend who is one of her main realtors that she partners with, who is like top real estate agent in Maryland as far as sales go. And she's already talking about how she wants to automate. She has a goal of having her system set up by 2024. Great. She knows a ton of people. She works with a ton of people, and she shared freely. Like, I've got people in line behind me who want this. They just don't quite know what they want yet. And I'm looking to surround myself with the right people to get this in place. 

Speaker 2
So whatever we do for her is a copy paste product for her mom, who does the same thing as she does mortgage lending and also probably copy paste for other lenders that work within her company that want the same automations. Of course there are going to be some fine tuning and tweaking, but we'll have the basic structure. And we very quickly facetimed her realtor friend when were meeting, and she was like, all right, I'm going to get this set up, and then you and I are going to talk and you're going to get it in. So it's not necessarily her employees, but a lot of her contacts and a lot of people she works with, realtors. 

Speaker 3
Her team, in a way. So her team are not her employees, right? 

Speaker 5
Yeah. Let's forget about the words employees might like. I wanted to ask about the team. 40 people, and all of those or most of those people are other mortgage lenders. So they basically real estate agents. 

Speaker 3
Most of those people. 

Speaker 5
Both or real silver? Both. So some of them are real estate agents, some of them are lenders. Got you. All right. Yeah, that would be great. Before we get into those learning and kind of a workshops, because I'm already visualizing how to work on those workshops with those guys and what might be their workflows. My guess is that of course, both of them of those groups work with clients and they provide some kind of advisory, but with different products. One is helping to look around in the breadth of financial products with mortgages and other is helping to find to look around in the breadth of listings and real estate purchases. So those going to be probably, I would probably divide those two groups in the different workshops, but that's a conversation for future. I just wanted to understand what the task on hand. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
They use pretty much the same tools and they would need the same solutions. So a real estate agent as well as a mortgage lender needs to follow up with clients. And those follow ups take a lot of time. So they're both looking for follow ups, automations, it's along those lines. So although what they do is relatively different and well, very differentiable within the industry, the solutions that they're looking for are very similar. The problems that they have, the pain points that they have are very similar. So let me throw you a couple ideas that we didn't come up with. Well, partly came up with, but that she told us that she needs. 

Speaker 3
And it was really cool to start working with someone who has an idea, a vision of what she wants, just not the tools to implement it and the desire to find the right people to implement. So. 

Speaker 5
Perfect. 

Speaker 3
First client, from my text messages, I receive a text message or I send a text message. Hey, lunch next week? Okay, great. Yeah, let's do 03:00 p.m. On Wednesday at X restaurant. From that message, there's a service. This is called open phone. It's one of the service. Tulio is a different service. For example, sorry to interrupt you. 

Speaker 1
Do we have something except this, because I kind of heard it already and I'm just 12 hours already in, so. 

Speaker 5
If we have something, if you need. 

Speaker 3
To take a break, go ahead, dude. Yeah, don't let me stop you. Bartech already saw all of this during the dev meeting. 

Speaker 1
All right, so let's catch up, I think, later. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, sounds good, brother. So from that text message, let's make a trigger. Well, it's natural language processing. Hey, is there an appointment here to set or not? Pretty much fusehot prompting anyway. And from that, connect your Google calendar to create an event. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. By the way, some time ago. 

Speaker 3
Oh, wonderful. We were actually looking for someone who had already, because were looking at which functionalities it's good at. But yeah, we can talk about that later. Number two, and not right now. But this is a second automation from the same branch from the text message to create a task in their CRM. Their CRM is called follow up boss. And to create a task, hey, we need, for example, details of the task pre approval for mortgage. And those are some of the most common messages that they get or tasks that they have to set. And sure, I'll look at it tomorrow. Tends to be the usual process. There's a request for an approval of a mortgage and then this person, page's cousin would look at it and then say, yeah, everything's okay, let's move forward. And she gave us a default. 

Speaker 3
Usually I want an alarm at 09:00 a.m. That will tell me, hey, what is the task that I had to do. Great. And then I'll remember. So we'll leave this for later, for now. And this coming week, ideally before Wednesday, we'll have this text message to calendar event created. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Okay. So this whole thing is, number one, I shaded emails because that's going to be a future thing. Her company needs to approve that. An outside service can read emails. There's a lot of sensitive data. So we'll keep it there for now. Text messages. Number two, action plans. Action plans are a series of tasks. So hey, pre approval for mortgage. What an action plan would be is if there is a new prospect, then step one is following up. And step two is pre approval. Whatever a person closes on a house, they bought it, mortgage got approved, and they will receive a gift, a physical gift. So we have to create a trigger to ask for a service that sends gifts to people, homes to send a gift. 

Speaker 3
Action plans based on who the person is, what kind of prospect, then do this action plan also follow up, boss. And those are the two things that we're going to implement in the coming days. 

Speaker 5
Let me double check. In terms of the action plan, are they asking for creating the action plans or they have their action plans already created and they want just to be automated? 

Speaker 3
That's a great question. They have a lot of action plans and also if there's an open house event, hey, tomorrow we're looking at this house and everyone's invited to come check it out. We do a tour, people sign up so they have their emails and their name, and the next day this person wants to add them to their CRM. Well, what they can do is just upload the file and tag. These people came to the open house or in an automated way, it would be sending us the file and through code through the API. We say, hey, the tag is open house, and the action plan that they would belong to is people that went to an open house. And we just upload the contacts directly to her CRM. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
And then the action plan triggers. 

Speaker 2
The action plan are essentially built in automations within follow up boss. And what's happened with my cousin is she recently moved mortgage companies, so she had follow up boss set up with all of her action plans and all of her client data in there. She was able to pull a lot of the data before she switched over, but now has to reset everything up. She's paying someone right now to put all of her data in here and clean up her. Like, right now, she's got 1300 client data with more to go. So the goal is that every client or every person has an action plan based on their tag, and they're tagged as, let's say these are some details we have to kind of work through with her, but they would be tagged as a realtor. 

Speaker 2
Okay, if I'm tagged as a realtor, then I'll be on this action plan. Because she wants to have one email per month touch all of her realtors, and every quarter, she wants to send out gift baskets to all of her realtors. In that action plan, we'd be coming into the points where, okay, there's already the trigger that this is the end of Q one. Now we need to trigger this outside message to go to the company she's already working with to put together gift baskets and send out to the appropriate people. For someone who's looking at buying a home for the first time, they might be tagged as a first time home buyer and follow this action plan where she wants to ensure she has x amount of touches with this person and follow ups as they go through their journey. 

Speaker 2
They get to settlement day. Settlement day hits, it triggers an automation that they get a handwritten celebration note and a bottle of champagne sent to there. And she's already got some of these puzzle pieces set up. Like, they have a service that puts together gift baskets for them. They have a service that sends out notes that are handwritten. It's just like connecting. Those would be the external integrations. 

Speaker 5
The connecting would be our job, or she has already hired, because you mentioned that there is somebody that is working on. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, good question. So, can we automate the email that the gift service receives saying, hey, this is the person, this is their address, send them this. This is the person, this is the address. Send them this. 

Speaker 5
It sounds like a no brainer, to be honest, in terms of exactly this thing, the example that you mentioned, I'm just thinking around. My understanding now is that you've been asked to help in this figuring out that she has moved the companies and she wants to move also her breadth of the huge workflows or those action plans that she had set up and she moved to a different platform or a different instance of the software. Right. And now some kind of a mess. Somebody works to help her organize with this new system. 

Speaker 2
To get to the next level. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
And to get to the next level we would be responsible to get it to the next level. Is it how standardized are those action plans among the industry in general, whether they're between different agents, different real estate agents or different mortgage, how do you call them, mortgage advisors? 

Speaker 3
It's a great question. 

Speaker 2
Mortgage loan officers. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, mortgage loan. 

Speaker 2
I would say there's a standard of sales methodology of you want seven touch points until I've gotten seven touch points and a meeting, blah. I don't consider this client a client or standards around following up at certain times to keep clients. But other than that, each realtor, each loan officer flies their own plane. They're associated with an agency, but it's up to them to keep track of these client touch points. However they build their system. For example, my cousin and her realtor friend Jess, they do a lot of gift baskets, they'll host events. They're very creative in how they give free value to their clients and how they appreciate their clients to get referrals. Not everyone's doing. 

Speaker 5
My guess is that you exactly have described what is either realtors or lenders. I would call them mortgage agents because very often they're called this way in Poland. So I'm mixing up the next. So let's call them mortgage agents. Both of those groups, they probably think about these workflows, these action plans as their unique differentiation or advantage. This is kind of years of experience of how to service the client. There is some kind of a playbook that is a standard among the whole industry, but you probably know where I'm going with that. Whenever you think about implementing an automation, you may always trying to scope the work and think about it in this way. 

Speaker 5
This is going to cost me x amount of hours of my effort and it's going to impact in this case probably one person or maybe a couple of people, because basically these agents doesn't want to share. They wouldn't be happy if you created automated their own know how and years of experience how to service the client and then go to all industry and just copy paste it. 

Speaker 3
So let me share what I saw regarding that. I saw templates and follow up boss that seemed really good. That seemed very straightforward, very simple, and probably pretty effective without any personalization, any uniqueness of the know how, or this specific business is just changing the name of the prospect. And I was actually impressed at how straightforward, natural sounding these messages were. However, there's going to be more on top of that when it comes to tagging people and putting them in the right action plan. Those things that would be manual, especially for adding new contacts in from an event, something like that. That's something that is very time consuming. That's something that this person does not want to spend time on, doesn't want to have to spend time on. 

Speaker 3
And in terms of standardization of say, following up in the industry, I think that is replicatable enough that there would be no, hey, but you made this for me with my help, that the agent wouldn't be like, this belongs to me. 

Speaker 5
There's no, okay, yeah. 

Speaker 2
On top of the fact that what Devin really, I think a dream outcome for her is if we get a solid set up using follow up boss and whatever integrations you can use, what follow up boss allows you to do, like many CRMs is have multiple users. So a realtor that she's working with know, essentially sign into some of the same accounts and be able to view the client pipeline without having to ask Devin. So there's this sort of seamless integration where all of the people involved in getting a client through the entire home buying process, which is a lot, are able to have this centralized access. And I mean, we talked for almost 2 hours and she was spinning ideas and there's a lot of ways that we're going to take this. 

Speaker 2
She's excited about it and she's like, I haven't even touched on my actual work. This is all for client touch point and retention. This doesn't even touch the processes that happen once someone goes under contract. 

Speaker 3
Approving a mortgage has many steps with many people. And there's two people involved in this from the second person that we met with was like, I'm getting all these dumb questions about things that should already be known by my team. So my team is asking me, hey, what's the fee on this? And it's stuff that she has either already told them or isn't a document that they just have to look into all those things that could be optimized and save everybody a lot of time and headaches we haven't even touched on. So that's what pegs is referring to now, the actual processes of lending a mortgage. 

Speaker 5
Sounds great. Okay, well, thank you for this answer. Just a small note. We know each other a little bit, but you're going to probably, as we are going further, get to know me that bit more. So we just mentioned about my character and how I work. I don't want to be discouraged that I ask questions because I always at the beginning think about like where is something that we might maybe omitted or haven't noticed. So it's not the thing that I'm trying to find. I'm just trying to find weak spots. But this is to be just sure that there is nothing that we will just crush into it. Right. That's why I'm asking. But this sounds really great. My guess was why I was asking these questions. 

Speaker 5
So I was thinking in the sense of how to, whether it is or not, kind of a project that you work a lot, but it impacts only one person's workflow versus impacting 100 people or 500 people. So when you speak to small businesses, business owners and especially freelancers, individuals like these guys, like those agents, my guess is, or my worry is that I will only impact their own one person job. Right. One person workflow. That's why I was asking about the standardization, whether we are able to copy paste the solution and multiply the effect, multiply the value, because we eventually want to end money. So I'm trying to assess how big the value is. Of course, that's going to be a great way and great satisfaction to improve one person's workflow. 

Speaker 5
But let's say that how that person would be able to price that she might feel eventually that how much it's worth. That's going to be the question that we would need to start thinking very early in the process. That's why I'm asking whether we are able to sell it more. That's why we would be able to approach her and say, yeah, if we are able to sell it in the future to different people, we can develop for you for free because we're going to earn some work in the future in the process. These are my thoughts. That's the way I'm thinking. Okay. Just want to. 

Speaker 4
This is everything we talked about. These are all her ideas. I just showed you two, which is this and this. And we still have all of this. We can talk about these later. It doesn't matter. But there's opportunity for several minor projects that have low effort, relatively low effort at medium impact, medium lifestyle impact. We showed up to the meeting yesterday and we started 45 minutes late because she forgot that she had a call at the time that were going to meet. It's lifestyle impact and her lifestyle is in great part entrenched in her job. So lifestyle impact is productivity at work impact. So at a medium impact, low effort, very replicatable for people that are going through the exact same pain points as she is. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. If she's open for reusing the templates to different realtors. 

Speaker 4
That'S what she wants. She wants the highest quality thing for her and for everybody around her that she works with. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, you mentioned about. Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 4
It's a very symbiotic relationship that they have, which is not the whole real estate industry. If you talk to an individual agent and you ask them how do you feel about other real estate agents? My assumption is that the answer is not going to be very positive. However, she's in a situation where if she wins and the people around her wins, everybody wins. 

Speaker 3
More. 

Speaker 4
Perfect, though your concern, or your question rather is very suitable, which is how standardized is it? The action plans that we're implementing for her as a mortgage lender versus a real estate agent. And sure, 1 hour and a half consultations will still be needed to find the suitable things, the tweaks, everything but thesis that once it's built, once the next builds are that much faster, it, in this case I believe it applies. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, sounds great. I'm looking for a deck. 

Speaker 4
And if you help us create a deck for Wednesday that would be fucking awesome. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, sure. At this moment I'm looking for kind of because you know that at the very beginning we worked with real estate agent. 

Speaker 4
Oh, I forgot about that. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, it was very early in our collaboration with Votek head name or company or a brand, just let me find. Yeah, well can I show you something at this moment? Let me share the screen. 

Speaker 1
1 second. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, you got it. 

Speaker 5
Bear with me. It's in polish and it's really old tech. Yeah. So what we have done with this first preclin, we also touched on their kind of a market position. This is the deck that I have created as a kind of a summary, our first discovery workshop and also kind of a process mapping workshop. So we've been also touching on their kind of strategy basically. And also we're trying to align their AI initiatives and automation initiatives to this positioning. So you won't understand a word, but I just wanted to say that after the couple of slides summing up the different initiatives, that's just similarly, as you have in your notion we have identified, this is the first initiative, the second initiative, the third, the fourth, 5th, 6th, 7th, all eight, blah, blah, doesn't matter. 

Speaker 5
We started to put those initiatives on the kind of four field axis when you compare ROI. So return on investment with kind of a speed to get the first results, time. So the horizontal line reflects the time and effort that is necessary to get the first result. And the vertical one is ROI. So we asked the guy, after getting, having those workshops finished and ideating on all those possible places that we can implement some automation, we asked the guy to score them the initiatives. Like we picked the first nine because we wanted to work in phases. We said that let's not discuss about 90 of them, let's focus on the first nine. That seems the best for the beginning and let's score them. Like the higher the scoring, the better ROI. 

Speaker 5
And oh, that's not the deck because I also had the one that had scoring and not the scoring, but the results. But you can just imagine that we had this map that showed us, or maybe let me show it on this one because I also showing kind of how we work with these things. So we very often work on processes. That's our kind of backbone of how we analyze the workflows and where we identify those opportunities to implement an automation. And when we identify the automation, we score it. As you can see here, very often it's quite good because of course the best position is to be high on ROI and fast to measure impact. 

Speaker 5
But quite often it's also wise to look for those quick wins that maybe they might have lower ROI, but are quite easy to implement, to have, for example, organizational buy in or stuff like that. 

Speaker 1
This is kind of. 

Speaker 5
But of course, usually the better ROI has those bigger initiatives and we try to put all those initiatives on this prioritization map. Also, we look like it's my thing because I love those strategic aspects. We also looking at the positioning of the company, whether they are kind of. For example, this is one of the frameworks that we can use. Whether you work or want to be a company that works in a kind of operational excellence or you are wanting to focus more on customer intimacy. So being very close to your client, this is typically the type of operation how real estate agents work because this is all about relations. So the operational model in this strategy is a little bit different than, for example, when you focus on product leadership or trying to be cost effective. 

Speaker 5
Just wanted to mention that this looks like a little bit like you are in this stage when you ideate all those solutions or maybe possible automation ideas. And I would suggest or recommend to you maybe to think about. Then let's move to the prioritization and roadmapping, what to go first with, where you already decided on a couple of those things. But you might think about whenever there's going to be a client that's going to be commercial, that there's going to be a money put on, that you might want to try to assess what's going to be the cost, what's going to be the time and what's going to be the value that is going to be brought by the solution and try to assess how much money they, for example, going to end on save. 

Speaker 4
So the two that I showed you are definitely the low hanging fruits, and that was off of her comments, but our intuition, I really like that we actually get to meet and explore this further with you today because you're bringing this more structured lens, right, where we can develop and then decide and have just clear justification for those decisions. And also on Wednesday, when we talk to the client and her team and her core team, which is four people, I believe we can show them. This is where we've mapped things in terms maybe of effort, and there could be a space where we say, what would be the ROI for you? Or we could estimate Roi based on the conversation we had yesterday. 

Speaker 5
Great. 

Speaker 4
Because she did make some of them very clear, like, oh, this would be a huge help right now. And when she goes a huge help, it's like, oh, okay, high Roi. So there were some that were very easy to identify as high roi opportunities. The two that I selected were the low effort opportunities that also will have, say, medium impact. But let's actually look at it in the map. What deck could you maybe send us? 

Speaker 5
Of course. Yeah. I'm happy whenever there's going to be, you see any value and exactly that why I'm showing, because I'm showing because I think that might be useful for you. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, for sure. We do need to simplify a lot. 

Speaker 5
Oh, yeah. 

Speaker 4
What the dev will look like. We're talking maybe four or five slides plus one or two of who we are at the beginning. Pictures of the team and stuff. Kind of set up the authoritative position and then four or five, something simple. 

Speaker 1
But that we do show. 

Speaker 4
Hey, these were the ideas that were discussed, where they fit in the ROI. What else comes up, what else needs to be put on this table? 

Speaker 5
Yeah, that's actually a great point or great occasion to get back to the nose rentals deck that I have got it to like 50% and because the guy wasn't ready for. But this is actually a good occasion to get back to him and say, hey, hello, how are you now? Because he told me that he is in a high season in the sense that he was so busy that I think that he dropped the kind of a program that we had been or met in because I haven't seen him on any of the work. 

Speaker 1
Oh, the mini Mba? 

Speaker 5
Yeah, I guess he was in the mini mba. I think so, yes. 

Speaker 1
Okay. 

Speaker 4
Okay. 

Speaker 5
And I have finished the program and I have never seen him again. So he's probably really busy. But that's going to be. 

Speaker 4
The busy season is ending now. 

Speaker 5
Oh, great. 

Speaker 1
It's already March. 

Speaker 5
That's a great. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
Okay. But probably I will drop canva because I have created one deck for syllabus some time ago, but I picked, as you are a subscriber, you can pick those kind of a premiere layouts that you have the designs already made for you. And the one that we started to work in is the one that you have all the elements you need to create them by yourself. So you have to basically draw from the blank page almost. So I started to draw a lot, but it was so time consuming that they go to the 50% and then move to another thing. Sorry, guys, but that's going to be actually a great. 

Speaker 4
Well, I'm sure if you, Powell and you, Paige, get together on canva, you'll be able to. 

Speaker 1
Figure out how to. 

Speaker 4
Make it fast, beautiful and effective together. Because I know both of you have. 

Speaker 1
Some experience on canva. 

Speaker 4
I know Paige has quite a bit. 

Speaker 1
Of experience on canva. 

Speaker 4
Relatively. In that case, if you want to drop your subscription, go ahead. We've been thinking about buying a subscription for faster eyes and it's probably a good time to do. Right, Paige? 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 4
Okay, cool. 

Speaker 2
Right now, I've just been using the subscription we have to my other company and it'd be nice to have a space for our stuff. 

Speaker 4
Be great. 

Speaker 5
Let me think about it. Actually, canva is not the most expensive. You know what's actually pretty expensive? I was thinking about purchasing LinkedIn Navigator, but it's not only LinkedIn Navigator, safe navigator. Sorry. But also you need to buy, purchase those data enrichment tools. It costs like €150. So we have a month. So we have actually using the data from our. We have this kind of a zack of ours that is really busy. There is an option on the table that he might maybe get to know you guys, but he got just recently from his own emailing called mailing campaign. He got so many inquiries, so many clients that he is not able to help us now. Lagging a little bit. He got so many clients, so he's really busy now. 

Speaker 5
But we are using a little bit of his databases and access, say that at some time, LinkedIn Navigator plus some kind of data enrichment, because when you get to the LinkedIn service navigator, you can pull downloads or databases, some contacts, but they don't have all the data. There are some extra services that enrich this data with emails, phones and anything that the user haven't shared. 

Speaker 4
Right. 

Speaker 5
How does it work? 

Speaker 2
I see. 

Speaker 5
But he's paying a lot of money and he has some kind of. 

Speaker 2
Okay. 

Speaker 5
Well, I can ask him for accommodations if he would be interested. Also, I know that Nan has hacked LinkedIn some time ago and shared some kind of huge database. I haven't looked into that yet. 

Speaker 4
What, you mean the 700 million contacts that I have in my computer right now? 

Speaker 5
Is it usable? 

Speaker 1
Have you looked at that? 

Speaker 4
It is time consuming to sift through, understand, and even try to open the files because they're so big that your computer just won't open them. But I'm a data scientist, so this. 

Speaker 5
Is literally. 

Speaker 4
It'S just not been enough time that I can actually create a map. But I do have a plan for drawing it out. And yes, the answer is yes. And we also have about 900,000 contacts for real estate in those lists. Out of which to be, if I were to estimate, probably 200, 300,000 are valid. Like valid emails. 200,000 is great. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. Let's say that we have 1% conversion. So that's 0.1% conversion. 

Speaker 4
It's more than we can handle. 

Speaker 5
It's more than we can handle. That's enough for a year of development. Exactly, yes. 

Speaker 4
So the massive outreach system, the personalized massive outreach system, partly scrapes a LinkedIn. 

Speaker 5
Page. 

Speaker 4
To get sort of relevant data. We might look into doing Instagram, too. We can look into that, but scrapes the LinkedIn data, including recent posts, and find hooks, find relevant things to start the email with, and we transition into value offer. 

Speaker 3
Sounds great. 

Speaker 4
I'm excited to show you that system. And there's going to be quite a bit of human review as we fine tune it. So us doing like a workshop one day where we say, hey, these are the icebreakers that it came up with. What is good about them, what is bad about them? And fine tuning each part of the process. And a B test, which we get to. 

Speaker 1
We get to a B test when. 

Speaker 4
We have that many contacts. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, I'd love to say it. That sounds really good in terms of this 700 million database thing. Have you been trying maybe putting uploading that because you have Microsoft account and some gold in this, my Microsoft account from this program that I.
