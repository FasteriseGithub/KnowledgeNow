AI meeting summary:
    • **Kuba** showcases integrating Pine Cone Vector Database and OpenAI embeddings to generate responses from meeting transcriptions. The team discusses agents essential to their system, including context enrichment, rag extractor, evaluator, QA, supervisor, merger, and answer formatting agents. Automated tasks like cleaning and rendering transcripts are considered for system input. Use cases like messaging bots providing assignment updates post-meetings are highlighted. 
    • Future iterations aim at self-refinement agents to enhance AI performance over time. **Kuba** introduces data integration methods, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high-quality underlying data for accurate outcomes. The team prioritizes achieving Minimum Viable Product (MVP) status before delving into complexities like contribution calculators or project log automation. Tasks are assigned among team members to progress product development focusing on different 'agents' within their pipeline.
