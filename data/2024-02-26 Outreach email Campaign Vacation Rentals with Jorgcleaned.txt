Speaker 2
So then I make a hook by creating sort of interest, to make them keep reading. I talk to them directly by saying, I thought I'd turn this by you because it's a pretty ridiculous proposal I think he'll be interested in. So just these two sentences, let them know that it's something that he should keep reading because there's some value in the email. And in my opinion, that's a pretty different approach than most people that go, hey, I work in x company. And so then after the hook, I go and talk about him, the company, and then I explain directly and precisely why am I messaging him. We could help you manage his pain point, which in this case we decided of managing the daily messages they get. And then the offer, is of course a free value. I just say we wanted you to help you for free, for your business, to save you both time and money. Using words, even though this is not the most formal way of writing, I think this could work to create this human touch.

Speaker 1
Okay. I hear the intent. Definitely agree with the intent. I think that these are very testable. I think you're onto something.

Speaker 2
That's almost it. As I said, I'm giving him free value that he could use to grow his business. And that's the goal here, to make him interested with no risk, because it's free. And then I explain how. So I analyze your sales funnel data and craft a strategy to save you both time and money. And then just a quick CTA. I used the negation, where I say, would you be against? Meaning that if he wants to work with us, he has to say no. In psychology, people like to say no. They feel a sense of empowerment.

Speaker 1
Negation is definitely a word you could use.

Speaker 2
And then the follow-ups are normal, not too detailed as the first one. There's not many structures, just overall having different approaches for the follow-up. The main goal here is to see how well the email performs and then how the follow-ups will help that performance.

Speaker 1
Okay, cool. Awesome. So let's try to log into the campaign.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Speaker 1
It should be okay sending it to you. I've been thinking a lot about what you said a while ago about all of us should be taking part in outreach. And I agree. I want to find the right timing for getting developers involved in outreach. It's warm outreach, developers reaching out to people they know being like, we build something awesome that you need to see.

Speaker 2
Yeah, everyone should contribute to outreach because nobody likes outreach and it's nobody's role to only do that. I personally do not like to call outreach especially, but I'm just doing it for everyone for the success of the business.

Speaker 1
Yeah, that's where we're at. We're doing what we need to do for the success. So what kind of outreach do you enjoy doing?

Speaker 2
It's still called outreach, but it's just on Instagram. I prefer it, especially to fitness coaches.

Speaker 1
Well, there are quite a few opportunities for Instagram outreach in the real estate space, which we're stepping into.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm definitely going to start outreach again.

Speaker 1
And I'll get you the leads in there. Explore those tabs under options. You'll see a bunch. Take your time to explore them.

Speaker 2
And for the user's name, how does that work?

Speaker 1
It does work. You can look at my previous campaign and see how it's formatted.

Speaker 2
Okay, and how much does it cost per campaign?

Speaker 1
It's unlimited campaigns. It's just $97 a month for everything. 

Speaker 2
Do you have any other headlines to test out?

Speaker 1
The simplest one ever, "Let's connect and first name." 

Speaker 2
Okay, thank you. Let's connect, so we have three different subject lines. That's good. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, let's stick with three and we can actually evaluate.

Speaker 2
So, what name should we use? Because we are having this Persona where basically we're talking as I.

Speaker 1
I used Alex.

Speaker 2
Okay, Alex, it's fine.

Speaker 1
No, you can definitely change the time. Let me try to find it.

Speaker 2
Do you know where most people are located?

Speaker 1
It's going to be in the US.

Speaker 2
Okay. All right. I'm done.

Speaker 1
Okay. Work. Come on. I believe in you.

Speaker 2
Can I get 1000?

Speaker 1
Let's go.

Speaker 3
More than that.

Speaker 1
We are going to delete some, for example, that don't have emails.

Speaker 2
That's awesome.

Speaker 1
Just far enough leisure, travel, tourism.

Speaker 2
Can you send me the link? 

Speaker 1
Send me the link on here too.

Speaker 2
Yeah, perfect.

Speaker 1
So now we need to identify which work in. We need some that we have actual emails for, otherwise we can't use them. So let's start there. We still have 1000 left though. And now we go back.

Speaker 2
Okay, I got everything. Where's the time? 

Speaker 1
You can definitely change the time.

Speaker 2
From 09:00 a.m.

Speaker 1
All right, schedule.Speaker 1
I can just get all of this into one big file. Fucking sick. Facebook. Company. Facebook. Company. Twitter. Hey, are you on Twitter? 

Speaker 2
No, I don't use Twitter. 

Speaker 1
Okay. Is there like line, bio, job line? Okay. We're good. Country. I can get everything into one big file like this. That would be a big win. Oh, is this their expected salary? That's fucking sick, dude. 

Speaker 2
What? Yes. 

Speaker 1
What? We have their fucking salaries. That's fucking sick. Oh my God. Okay, cool. Where are we going from here? This is the date gathered. So we have to go verify the emails. It's number one. But in order to do that, we need to be able to get this into one big list. Get this into. Unless this works. If I don't think it's going to. But we can say, hey, Ryun, email verification file. Let's try it. It. Yeah. I wonder what I know I can do is say, hey, if this column has multiple emails. Multiple. If this column called email one has multiple emails, then I need a new one. What I need to do is get to downloads. 

Speaker 2
What? You want me to download the. 

Speaker 1
Oh, no, sorry. I'm just talking out loud like a crazy person. And now I say I just need to get these emails right so you can actually send them. And about 600 of them are valid. And we'll see what those are. We are here and we're saying, hey, there are multiple emails here. Are any of them valid? Are all of them valid? Tenncy 21 ten and C 21. But it didn't check the other one. So that's an issue. So what I need to do is identify. Hey, where are these? More than one. And I need to duplicate the lines. Put the email under that easy. Okay. This might take me a little bit. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, it's okay. 

Speaker 1
So I will get these to you. I'm going to continue working on these. What I would love for us to have. Okay. For us to have mike. Okay. Look at those emails again in the campaign. So if we can look at those, that'd be great. Could you share a screen on your end? 

Speaker 2
The emails are already on the. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, I wasn't able to see them on my end. So if we can look at them. 

Speaker 2
Okay, sure. It's here. Can you see? 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
So maybe because how are those three the same? Just change the sub. 

Speaker 1
Cool. 

Speaker 2
And then just. We've got the follow ups. 

Speaker 1
Yes. 

Speaker 2
And they are just simple. As we discussed long ago. We have five follow ups I think. 

Speaker 1
Instantly will only let us do five emails in total. So one and then four follow ups. 

Speaker 2
You sure? 

Speaker 1
I'm pretty sure. That might be for the old plan. We might need to double check that. 

Speaker 2
But, yeah, it's okay. In that case, you can remove one. We've got the follow ups. Here's the first one. 

Speaker 1
Okay. 

Speaker 2
I'm not going to read, though, but if you want, just go. 

Speaker 1
No, it's fine. 

Speaker 2
Then for the days. So I put for the first follow up one day. Pretty simple. Then three days, then seven days. So four day difference. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
I don't know if I might do like four or three and six. What do you think? Four is a long. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. I would actually go like 246246 here, but I'm not an expert at this. 

Speaker 2
It just makes sense. Don't worry. Me too. 

Speaker 1
To leave two days between the first and the second message. Okay. Yeah, that works. 

Speaker 2
Then a bit more time for me. Say nine. 

Speaker 1
Sure. Yeah, that works. Cool. And then for times. What were you thinking? 

Speaker 2
97 Pacific time. 

Speaker 1
That's it. Okay, cool. In that case, 09:00 a.m. Pacific is already noon in the east coast. So we would want to start sending from earlier. Right. Six m. And then we shifted. Yeah, that works. So six to four. Six to five. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Cool. Okay, awesome. And remember to hit save on everything you change. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
And could we go to the first email? There's something I wanted touch on. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Let'S see. I just thought I'd read this by you because pretty ridiculous press I think you'll be interested in. I was looking at and had a few ideas I'm confident could help you manage the growing daily messages. So to show confident me and my team are going to give you quick overview of how we could level up your business for free. 

Speaker 2
Maybe not. I. So it's will analyze because I'm saying me and my team. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. So then the offer that we're doing here is essentially a customer service bot. Yeah. 

Speaker 2
So should we say, instead of a strategy, should we just say a customer buff? 

Speaker 1
Well, I think we should look at a couple of lines before first we'll get to that final sort of hit line, like the punchline. I was looking at company and had a few ideas and confident could help you manage the growing daily messages. They're not really ideas anymore. They're products. They are services. I see the intentionality behind the word ideas. 

Speaker 2
I hope you manage growing daily messages a few ways. What would you say? 

Speaker 1
Mmm. 

Speaker 2
Maybe something like just strategies. 

Speaker 1
But. 

Speaker 2
Feels kind of long. 

Speaker 1
I like strategies. Strategies. 

Speaker 2
Plan. So here I can use and craft a plan to save you both time. Not plan. 

Speaker 1
Okay. So to show you how confident me and my team are, I wanted to give you a quick overview of how we would level up your business for free. What else? Funnel data. Sales funnel data for vacation rentals. What is their funnel data? What do they do? What do vacation rentals do for, do they do, like, ads? 

Speaker 2
No, I mean, just what I was thinking by sales funnel data is just overall the data of their business, just for us to know how they're going and all that. Because the revenue and the time spent on taking care of messages, just overall their information. Just wanted to make it more fancy. 

Speaker 1
Okay, cool. 

Speaker 2
Should I change sales funnel or no? Maybe it's too specific in terms of they do not know what sales funnel mean. 

Speaker 1
For me, it screams, oh, these guys are trying to sell me something. Then again, it is accurate. If we get a view into that, then we can do strategy for them. 

Speaker 2
Maybe it's something more friendly. 

Speaker 1
My issue is now it's ambiguous what exactly we're selling here. Is it like strategies to manage growing daily messages or like optimizing the sales funnel? 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
And what exactly are you doing with the growing daily messages? Because they could have people answering them. 

Speaker 2
I mean, inherently, if we take care of the daily messages, we optimize their funnel. It's a question. 

Speaker 1
Yes, that makes sense. I'm worried that would make sense to us and just confuse somebody who doesn't see the connection because we're talking about what we do. What is their dream outcome here? And can we put an example of that dream outcome in there? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I mean, their dream outcome is just to have more time maybe as said long ago, to have time with their family and all that. That's what I think is their desire or something like that. 

Speaker 1
Okay. 

Speaker 2
If I'm not wrong, I think I wrote this because I've got two of those emails, but the other one is bitch longer. Let me see. Code. 

Speaker 1
And I had a few strategies I'm confident will help you manage the growing daily messages we're getting off the season. So daily messages are probably not growing. They're probably going down. But what we could, since it's almost March, what we could say is, like in preparation for the summer season, we have few strategies. It's not really managing because managing. They could hire somebody for $2 an hour to manage the messages. So what is really leave the value here. 

Speaker 2
So something else I wrote on another email was to decrease the expenses on service reps. So that goes to another. 

Speaker 1
Increase expenses on, sorry, service reps. Service reps. I could see it. 

Speaker 2
Should I wrote that instead? 

Speaker 1
Hold off on that thought for a second. Reducing expenses on service reps. 

Speaker 3
What if we could say the same thing talking about someone else? What if we could say the same thing by. We saw this, we saw X impact on Y company who implemented this and that, or implemented this and. 

Speaker 1
That. 

Speaker 3
Who saved thousands of dollars. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I know this outreach method, I think I got it too. Let me search. There are many ways to outreach, and this one is one way to outreach to have. It's called like, you steal someone's authority to use it with you. Basically, something I did with that is basically, hey, I saw that big company, for example, Tripadvisor, is implementing AI in a way that you aren't. And considering they're making millions or even billions, you might consider to take a look on what they're doing or something like that. Let me try. Search the one you told me. 

Speaker 3
Something like that. Just simpler. I was thinking from the fundamental rather than from the strategy. From the fundamental of how do we show them that there's something that they want? Because we can go and test it. Hey, let's go and test it. I just don't feel like, oh, yes, this will click because they will know for sure that this is something that they want and that this is something that they need. But we're talking about it as opposed to showing it or showing the results. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. So you mean a case study email? 

Speaker 3
Sure. Case study. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
We don't have a case study. That's the problem. 

Speaker 3
So how I worded it, at no point is there a. We built this for them, but they implemented this and this is the results that they saw, which is totally fair game when it comes to the product itself. We have the product with a few tweaks, we have the product. That's part of why I wanted you to come to the dev meeting today, because we have a lot of products. What you saw today is one of them. Your help will greatly appreciate it. But we have a. This chat bot concierge. And in that chat bot concierge, you do a few tweaks and suddenly it answers all the questions to prospects as opposed to guests. So we're like almost there. We're also asking, is this something that you want? Or maybe it's interactions with your guests that you want to have solved. 

Speaker 3
So in this initial campaign, we're asking, hey, when people message you to get details about this house or this apartment or this vacation rental, is that a pain point for you? What we could be asking in a future campaign is current guests asking you stuff and one in questions answered right away, is that an issue? And how much are you spending on solving that issue? So that type of clarity is what I feel we need to portray. 

Speaker 2
Can I say what I think? Yeah, go ahead. 

Speaker 3
Final decision is yours, just so you know. 

Speaker 2
No, it's not that. So for me, everything you're doing on the death thing is actually amazing and all that. But for me, I think it's just better to focus one, two, or at max, three different services and just master them and be the best at that. And then, because I think there's this quote from Alex Ramosi who said something like, you don't need more than one or two niches or one, two, three services. What you need is just to be the best at what you do. And whenever you become the best at what you do, in order to scale, you have to have different approaches and have different niches and all that applies in everything, that applies in outreach, that applies in niches. As I said, that applies for me in the services. 

Speaker 2
So I think we should focus more into one or two services. Just be the best on that, be the best business service, to deliver that service and just be known for that service and deliver so much value that they will just refer to other people. The problem by making all those services, which definitely are great, I'm not saying they're not, is that we are sort of forgetting about the quality we want to give up to the clients. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, absolutely, man. Totally right. 

Speaker 2
Because, yeah, I think we should be known for, I don't know, for these kind of for one kind of service, two kind of services we should not be known for because, yeah, we can do everything. From my point of view, from prospect's point of view, would you prefer to work with someone that is an expert on this service or would you prefer working with someone that is an expert on everything? So what I mean is that you have more authority when you say I only work on this service because I want the best quality for you and yeah, that's what I think. 

Speaker 3
Okay, well, let me show you. 

Speaker 2
How many services do you have right now that you can, what I'm about to show you. Okay. 

Speaker 3
I do want your opinion on this. 

Speaker 2
I can't see that. 

Speaker 3
How about now? 

Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
So we have built already the ski chalet concierge, which is the same product, different side of the product. This is a concierge for vacation rentals for guests, for improving the vacation rental experience. Let's solve your customer service questions for potential guests. Is the same chat bot with different prompt, but everything else is actually the same. So that's actually quite interesting. That's why I talk with one step away from converting it. That's something we have built, but not something we want to properly focus on. I think the vacation rental field, we might be onto something and there might be opportunity and we're just trying to dig out whatever opportunity there might be there for an initial client. So this is why we're doing this campaign and we're continuing these campaigns. Scheduler assistant is a more complex product. 

Speaker 3
This is for the logistical nightmare, the logistical pain point of retail companies, for department stores, for having to manage hundreds of employees and have them assigned at different times in different places. Right now most companies do this manually and it's crazy that they do that manually. So there was an opportunity there and we built a product for it. This is something that Henry might actually be able to sell to the company that he works at. So something we finished because we saw potential in for a sale, not necessarily potential of becoming this being the identity of fasterized, which is kind of like along the lines of what you're asking, lead qualifier. This is something we initially built. If we want to do something with this, we need to put some more work. But it's great for ads. 

Speaker 3
It's great for running ads and actually going straight into a chat for qualification of leads. This is great for us, this is great for any of our clients that a lot of them are going to want marketing work. And this could be an implementation of, yeah, we'll run your ads or we'll improve your website or whatever. And also we have this for getting better leads. Anyway, this is stuff we have worked on in the past. What we're currently working on are three things. A Zoom transcriber, the recording that is happening right now, having a transcription and putting it into a database integration. What that enables is the context is the base of knowledge for any other applications that is very abstract and it will become clearer later on. 

Speaker 3
So grabbing a call, a recording, making a transcription, and then having that knowledge available for a chat, for example. Knowledge base builder leverages that previous this is essentially one service. This is all essentially one service, which is a knowledge base builder. Grabbing all of the information from the company, including the calls, but also including the documents, the public conversations, their marketing, everything, and putting it in one place. That makes it so. Xxx that makes it so. There's an assistant that accompanies every employee. So there's instant summaries of every meeting and clear action tasks. A lot of things evolve from this knowledge base. Some of the things, for example, are. 

Speaker 2
Give me a second. 

Speaker 3
I promise there's a point to this and I'll show you. Okay, this is what that looks like. A knowledge based builder with the context and all the calls, with the transcripts, getting to a point where we have all that knowledge stored, and with that knowledge we can do a lot of different things. People have talked about a personal work coach, essentially an AI assistant, but that can also prioritize work or that can also do product management. Use cases. So this is where the use cases come parts in. Massive outreach system is part of what we've built, what we've worked in. And we want to know that when we're sending whatever email, it's relevant. It's relevant to the person we're sending it to. And it's relevant to us too. 

Speaker 3
We want to know that if we have a fast drive AI assistant, it's relevant that it has the context of the company, of the employees, of the clients, of the products we've worked on. Part of that context gets gathered by these calls. Hey, what are we working on? What improvements or what has the development team been working on, et cetera, that enables use cases? To answer your question, the core service for faster eyes will be this. But this is very abstract when you can't really just sell this. This is a foundation for an application that can get built from AI dialers, dude, from anything. You need context. So we're going to build this for us. We're going to build other stuff for clients. 

Speaker 3
However, what are those things at the moment, customer service for vacation rental is very low hanging fruit in that way because it's clear what the purpose is to save money on customer service reps. Save time in you having to answer those questions. But the reality is that we don't really want to do that forever. And answering your other question, the industry that we're going into as a focus very soon is real estate. Real estate is going to be one of our big ones, one of our core ones. Actually, scratch that. It's going to be our core industry. We have some contacts. We're meeting up with some people this week. We're figuring out what is it exactly that they want and need and building that and the process of building that. We're like, halfway through, I'm going to stop. 

Speaker 3
But anyway, through building that real estate product, then we're going to mass sell, mass outreach. And we already have about almost a million contacts after we validate addresses, probably between three and 400,000 people across the US, real estate agents, we have their contacts. So that's set up. We just need to. This week, Paige and I are sitting down with real people in the real world, which is very rare for us, being so remote and digging through the details and getting some sales. So through those sales is. Oh, other real estate agents might want this. For example, a potential buyer or a potential seller. A potential buyer is messaging the real estate agent. Hey, have you found anything new? Have you found anything new? And it could be very easy to implement. 

Speaker 3
Hey, here are these three new listings you might be interested in, based on the three listings you saw last week or the three listings I shared for you, and it's an automatic SMS. That is something that real estate agents in general have shown interest in. Is that our product? 

Speaker 1
Maybe. 

Speaker 3
The point is, this week we're solidifying the use case and the industry, which we already know that we're going to properly focus on moving forward. So why do all these email stuff for vacation rental? Number one, practice, because we need to have solid outreach. And that's why I'm so excited about you taking on that. So you can give it a sort of full focus into making as good frameworks, as good emails as you can and getting evidence for how good they are. And number two, because we actually might be able to get some sales through these. So that's the chapel. That's where we're headed. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. That makes more sense. Now. I have nothing to say for what you describe. I'm pretty hopeful and have many, let's say. I think this can actually work. And if it does, we can get a lot of money out of this, because it's, in my opinion, pretty unique. And not many people are doing this, I guess. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I think you're right. And we'll go and test it. Until we have evidence. We won't know. So let's go get that evidence. 

Speaker 2
But just the thing is that, for example, wouldn't you have the opportunity to make this after we get the client, or this needs to be done before. Right now? 

Speaker 3
That's a good question. Yes and no. We are sitting down with real estate agents this week to talk to them about that and maybe even build those things for them. So we have the case study. We have like, hey, these were the results of what we built for this person anyway, for this real estate agent. Here are the results. Here's what happened. So, we will have something built, but our new person might want something different. So the core will be the same, and we'll have one, two, maybe three sellable products after a while. But we will start with, this is what they want. Let's build it for them. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I see. Of course. So just have the foundation. Because I was thinking that, of course. I think that, as I've said hundreds and hundreds of times, the output should be the focus. And I was thinking that after we get the client, we can build that service, or we can build that. 

Speaker 3
Exactly. 

Speaker 2
Whatever. And if we can build that thing whenever we get assigned and not before, I think we should shift our perspective and shift our focus towards outreach. 

Speaker 3
I see what you're saying. See, I think you're correct. And I've been learning the difference between being correct and being right. I think you're correct in that what you're saying makes absolute sense. Being right is a little more nuanced. I also think you're right. I also think that now is the time where we should put as much focus from as many people as possible into outreach and getting clients. I think the timing is right. I think development is ready, and I think now that you have these two weeks, which is super exciting, it's like, okay, let's just make this happen. Okay, so, outreach. Focus on outreach. But, dude, what we've been building last four months made it. So I don't know if you heard this story. 

Speaker 3
Paige and I went to an event, an AI event, where this guy was talking about chat GBT and how to use it and how to make it useful. And before the event started, we talked to the guy, and he told us, dude, I'm, like, sharing these things that I'm learning, but you guys are actually building these things. Would you like to come up on stage to share some of what you do? Yeah. Halfway through the talk, he's like, there's some people here from another country that want to share some cool stuff that they are building. I'm just talking about it, but they're building it. And we go up on stage and were so comfortable. We felt like we knew exactly what the fuck were talking about. 

Speaker 3
And we've been building these for now four months, which is like, oh my God, we've been building for four months and we haven't been focusing on outreach. But even Paige, who's not a programmer, was able to get up on stage and be like, this is exactly what we do, and this is exactly how it works, and this is exactly how it can help you. It was mind blowing, man. It was how ready were to just improvise, get up on stage and talk about who we are and what we do. And I think that's very powerful. Any more focus we put into anything that isn't outreach, any focus we take away from outreach now is not going to have the same return that the first focuses on. Hey, let's build some products so we get comfortable with building. 

Speaker 3
So we get sort of a muscles warmed up. We're there. We're very much there. The speed of development that Kuba and Bartek and Henry have is incredible now. Much better than before. So we're ready to have a client have a call and then build a prototype within days, which is fucking awesome. And it's very rare in the development world. So I want to give you that context. There was a purpose to focusing on stuff that isn't solely outreach. And right now we have the emails, we have the industry super clear. We have the. We have some tests of frameworks that we want to use and how they'll fit together. And we have one initial idea of a product that real estate agents might be interested in. 

Speaker 3
And in this week, we're going to solidify, we're going to build, say, these two things, and this is what we're going to go sell. 

Speaker 2
Okay, yeah, I just didn't understand for the last part. Do you want the dev team to work on the outreach or you want them to keep working on the project you're doing? 

Speaker 3
Well, the outreach project is going really well. They're going to continue working on it. 

Speaker 2
But. 

Speaker 3
Because I'll get to show you its full capabilities later, there's useful stuff there. It just needs guidance. I'm so excited for you to guide it in the human way. However, when a project comes in that has any potential, even if it's just a conversation that we have with a real estate agent and it has any potential of becoming something we sell for money, then the focus is going there. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, of course. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, absolutely. 

Speaker 2
Okay. 

Speaker 3
For now, they're having good momentum on this project, so let them do their thing. And they're engaged and it's very important to keep them engaged. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
So let's give one last look at your email. 

Speaker 2
Okay. 

Speaker 3
Ola Mama Yorg, come with us. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm sorry, my mom just came in. I think you heard her. Yeah, maybe I'll have to go in like five minutes. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, five minutes is all we need. Could you flash screen and we'll get. 

Speaker 2
Those emails sent. 

Speaker 1
Here. 

Speaker 2
Can you see? 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Perfect. 

Speaker 2
So you want to change this, right? 

Speaker 3
I have two questions if you go to the very top of that one. 

Speaker 2
Here. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. Why are those two lines separated? Is that a thing? 

Speaker 2
Where? Here? 

Speaker 3
Yeah. I thought I'd run this by you because it's a pretty good. 

Speaker 2
You can do that for me. It's more aesthetic to the eye, but I don't know, just my thing. I just like it like that. It doesn't matter what it is. Okay. 

Speaker 3
And then I was looking at company and had a few strategies. I'm confident going to help you manage growing daily messages. So to show how confident me and my team are, I want to give you a quick overview of how we would level up your business for free. We'll take a look at your data and craft a strategy to save you both time and money. If you're open to the idea, would you be against a quick chat about cool, sounds good. And do we want to put Alex and then the title, no, Alex. And then the role at the company. Alex. 

Speaker 2
We can do that. So we can do two things. So we either go the formal way. So Alex, founder or something like that. Or Alex, your AI tech buddy, but not buddy, but something like that. Like something more friendly. I don't know. We can do one of both. What do you. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, that one sounded fun. Alex, AI, your new. That makes it seem like an AI wrote this message. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Your AI tech buddy. Your AI expert buddy. Tech buddy. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, that's good. 

Speaker 3
Okay. Alex, your AI tech buddy, Alex. Alex. Yeah, no hyphen as in like the. Yeah, that works. You're a tech buddy. Cool. Sounds good, man. That's fun. 

Speaker 2
Should I add this one to you on the other? 

Speaker 3
Yes, let's do that. And I am going to work on getting you the right emails and we'll send it in a couple of hours. We'll make sure it's sent. 

Speaker 2
Let's add some words to make it more deep and cool. 2 seconds. My mother is calling me again. I keep the last one without it because it's kind of. If you read it's more direct and formal. 

Speaker 3
1 second. What's that? 

Speaker 2
Okay, cool. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, sounds good. Sounds good. Okay, cool. Good job, man. I will let you know when the leads are uploaded into instantly.
