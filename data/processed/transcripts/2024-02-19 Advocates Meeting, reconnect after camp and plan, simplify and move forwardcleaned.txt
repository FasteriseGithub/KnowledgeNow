Speaker 1
Realizing what's important is the words you used. It feels a lot like realizing what's not important, realizing what's noise, realizing what's not critical. There's such clarity of what has to happen next that I had no doubt in my mind that would get there. And what does that look like? I'll get to the tangible in a second.

Speaker 2
As you know, we've been focusing very much on sales and we closed the client closed the first very small project with him and a lot of work, great work on the side of Bartek. So kudos to Bartek.

Speaker 2
After the time of really having a lot of pressure, we hope that we'll manage to streamline those processes, at least in terms of syllabus. And that was the main focus. Let's go back to discussions about faster rides. I would like to push the competency metrics that we've been in talks with, and also I have developed kind of a roadmap for projects for Ops for 2024. Just wanted to create kind of a list of priorities, a list of projects that in the longer run should be covered in this space.

Speaker 1
We will recheck on the competency matrix another time this week.

Speaker 1
Excited to hear that you close the client, man. That's awesome. And that experience, working with a client more smoothly helps all of us understanding the process from hey, lead, it's getting better. And actually closing helps all of us. So I'm really excited for you guys.

Speaker 4
I've been doing this chatbot basically for all this time, most of this time. Been able to make an upsell on one of the feedback calls. So that's what we are hoping for, to be closed as a bigger project, as Pablo mentioned.

Speaker 4
I've been trying to find some time to work towards making a new version of PFA, but it's still just a concept. I have some plans to make it like kind of mentioned this GPT mentioned swarm, something like this. So have a few GPTs that can mention each other. 

Speaker 1
Multi agents communicating with each other is going to transfer context. That actually makes it useful and not generic. And the more technical part, the wood vector databases we're using for the knowledge base. Alvi had some great comments today on how do you make the information flow more useful? 

Speaker 1
There is so much on these knowledge base conversations that we've had over the last few weeks, so much on the applications of hey, now we have all these companies' information and it's in a vector database and we're going to do useful things, retrieving it.

Speaker 1
We'll start doing YouTube shorts. How does this play into our plan? And I will map this out because it's all in my head and I don't want to lead you guys through some abstract image of what I'm picturing, but damn, the image is so clear in my head. Let's get to work. Let's get to something finalized. Let's get to something we can show. That's a step number one.

Speaker 1
I'm going to do a lot of work this week on getting this automated transcript maker that feeds the knowledge base up and running so we can actually put it out on YouTube so we can like, hey, here's a 1 minute short, and here's another 1 minute short.

Speaker 1
We should focus on this so we can have a thing that we're doing that has a purpose, a very clear purpose. And the outcome is very clear, you guys, is the sale.

Speaker 2
I'm developing, bringing in and developing and changing, updating a lot of different frameworks that the overarching theme for those frameworks is. The one theme is how to like whenever there's going to be a client, that the main pain point is around adoption of AI. How do you do these training or workshops to learn people how to use AI within their workflows, how to identify this stuff.Speaker 2
This is also the thing that I've been working on very much for last couple of days, last couple of weeks as I've been finishing this kind of extract course that I've done. It's called mini MB, a for AI for business. So I've closed this project last week also, and I'm gathering all this knowledge to change a little bit, develop myself, put my stuff that I also have from my past experience and develop these kind of a frameworks. So this is one of a kind of a syllabus kind of a know how and knowledge that we would be able to fit into this knowledge base. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
And another stuff is mostly connected with my previous background experience that I've been working for many years for a strategic consulting boutique here in Poland that was very closely associated with MBA program on Waso University. So this is another space, this is very much connected to kind of basically the frameworks and the knowledge that you learn on business studies worldwide. And I'm also working in the background on this kind of frameworks for how to, whenever there's going to be a client that would like to learn how to push the differentiation that the company has. As we've had this conversation, probably you remember that there's going to be a future when each company's employee going to use this personal AI assistance in the situation where each company, they work for us, they're going to work on the basis of the same AI. Where's the differentiation? 

Speaker 2
So this assistance needs to be covering, conveying, pushing the unique know how knowledge that this company has built for the years along, for many years, right? So this knowledge, this know how is in their Sops, in their procedures, in their joint experience and know how of their employees and all this space going to be sometime there's going to be a need to learn the underlying AI, the underlying knowledge bases for each of the corporations, each of the company separately, so they remain the competitive advantage. So this is the thing that we call it with Bartech, we call it strategic alignment of the underlying AI, of the underlying knowledge base. That's a huge thing. And I'm working on that as a kind of a second focus for celebrities. 

Speaker 2
And there is a discussion that is still quite niche, but in the space of AI, I see that more and more professionals are starting to discuss about it. So there's going to be probably a growing trend and discussion about how to differentiate my AI and yours AI to remain and keep this strategic differentiation for our company. Yeah, so those are the two spaces that I'm very much interested in. The second one is a little bit more future focused and a little bit like not very much. It's still in development, so it's not ready to use the knowledge base that you are building in. But in terms of the first one that I have some training, some documents, some stuff to fit in the knowledge base, I would be very happy to experiment with that. 

Speaker 5
Something that comes to mind for me in terms of what we need to look out for is I don't want to provide a solution to a client and then one month later OpenAI release the same feature and they go, oh, I got scammed, or something like that. So being aware of what's coming out, for example, something that's similar to the knowledge base retrieval thing that we're doing is Microsoft's copilot. So I'll look into that and see how I think it differs slightly. Like you can ask, oh, questions about the meeting and it can answer them, but it won't be as rag oriented or stuff like that. 

Speaker 1
Not yet. That's part of what Avi was talking about that Microsoft is already starting to implement. Hey, here's everything we know about your company and here's how to make it useful. And it brings up an interesting point, which is we think we're early to the party. How late are we actually? Let's say we are late, we find a client and we start working with them. They pay what costs, which is not cheap. And then what happens? Microsoft comes out with a similar product. What do we have? Well, we have, number one, the relationship with them, showing them that we can build something of quality. And then it just upsells because we know them. Microsoft doesn't know them. 

Speaker 1
Microsoft has information about them that they can do in something useful, of course, but the relationship and the context is so much more powerful to create a long term business relationship of doing useful things for them, things of value, than like, oh, we have better technology, so we understand your information better. That's why that first client is so vital, because it leads towards, oh, these guys know how to work. These guys understand this thing, oh, these guys are building something similar to what Microsoft is building. Oh, interesting. Yeah, exactly. So late to the party. Early to the party. The reality is we're early because most CEOs, most companies are not ready to implement this. And that's the key here, that they're not ready. So we have time. We have time. I know you're going to bounce, Bartech. 

Speaker 1
Good luck with your next meeting and we will most certainly connect. Yep. 

Speaker 2
See ya, guys. 

Speaker 3
See ya. 

Speaker 5
That was a perfect answer, man. 

Speaker 1
I'm telling you, man, it's so fucking clear in my head. Yeah, I have not a single doubt in my head. And I don't want that to mean, okay, let me put it this way. If that starts coming through as me having all the answers, please pause me, please stop me, because I don't have all the answers. I just have clarity of a to 1 second. 1 second, definitely. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
It reminds me actually of another company that they're called class stars. I don't know if I've talked to you about class stars, Alejo, a little bit before. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, I remember. 

Speaker 3
You remember class stars. The issue is that they are imposing their system. Imposing might be a strong word on teachers as opposed to providing the technological structure for a school to align their principles and their methodology within the technology. So in Bermuda, this coaching program, which I think could be licensed by the International Federation of Life Coaches, they just don't have the official cert, probably haven't paid for it. They have a very unique system that they use. Right. Another coaching program or mentorship program might have another system that they use. So a sort of skeleton that could match or align with each different sort of methodology for an organization is what I'm mulling over in my mind. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, totally. 

Speaker 3
And also I guess on a related but similar, related but tangential note, I am feeling a bit like I have my feet in too many lanes and I want to figure out what the lane is with faster eyes, where I can be most effective and have most of my strengths in which on the business development side is education, is having these conversations with educators and figuring out what some of the biggest challenges are. And I don't have the bandwidth to do that and outreach and make social media posts and market. Then it just kind of feels like I'm kind of hitting deliverables in all of those areas but not really thriving in one. That's sort of where I'm at. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, I get that. 

Speaker 1
Yes. 

Speaker 5
Makes sense. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
I think we've all kind of felt that way at one point or another in the last few months. A lot of everything. And I want to be able to do the thing that is most effective for the organization. That also doesn't drain as much because I enjoy so much. Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. 

Speaker 3
There's an acceptance of this. Of what bandwidth do we realistically have with the people who are at the table right now and what is the priority? It's important that we have a presence. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, I think what I'll do is I think building in public is the simplest way to hosting and working at the same time. So, for example, when we had a dev meeting, I spoke about how I was learning these courses online on stuff. So I'll just do videos on those courses and then just share them with you guys. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, we can do. Asked him. I asked Henry. Hey, you're doing this course. Teach it to us. Come share what you learned. And now we're going to have it recorded because we record everything and we can put it into shorts. That could be a five short series, even like DL knowledge bases for applications. Core lesson one. One out of five. And we have one week of content there. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, and maybe that's the shift is let's just post videos about what we're doing. Let's teach people, let's give the free value. We've been talking about as far as educating people about AI, about tools, about how they can use it, about what we're learning, and that's content. We don't need to write long LinkedIn posts about whatever that chat GBT mostly wrote anyways. It doesn't really resonate with people. They want the human. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. Something I was thinking about today was because I was thinking about, okay, how could lewis like, get better? And I was thinking about, okay, when I'm working, what do people like the most? And it's like people, either they come into the store for two things. It's either they know what they want to buy and they're just here to grab it and go, or they want to talk to someone and learn something and then decide if they want to buy or not, but they first want to learn and then decide. And the amount of people that, for example, every time I've gone, okay, let me explain to you how the computer works. This is the Ram, this is the CPU, this is how they work together. Then almost every time they buy, instead of. 

Speaker 5
If I was just going to be like, oh, this is the computer you need. It's not always the best tactic, but along the same sort of trajectory. When I've had it, for example, that economist, when I just showed him chat GPT and it was the most simplest thing and he was allowed to just see it, he had the best reaction and was open to so much. So, for example, just posting, oh, this is chat GPT, could get so much engagement just alone. 

Speaker 3
I think what's really cool about coming from the environment that we just came from and the methodology that we've been getting training on, that I've been training on for the past eight years now around how to guide learning experiences is unique from how most YouTubers are teaching things. And I think that could set us apart. Like Liam's got how many videos on how to use Chatcheet BT some of them are very highly technical. But what if we show not tell, right? What if we make it? I mean, I feel like I need to show not tell right now because it's like the facilitation style of teaching and learning that has a lot of potential to be extremely engaging and then speak to people where they are in their world. 

Speaker 3
Something that we talk about with kids is when we're connecting content to examples, it's, well, how do we bring their world into our world? What are they into? What music are they listening to? What TV shows? What video games? What is their day to day reality or an experience that they have that I can draw from. Oh, you know that feeling when you stay up late, you start playing a video game and then 4 hours go by and you realize it's midnight and you've been playing for 4 hours and you're like, I was supposed to do my homework. Everyone's like, kids have been there. Or when you know you're supposed to be doing your chores and your parents are nagging at you and you just get the annoying feeling. So finding those ways to incorporate that into video learning, right, it's a little. 

Speaker 1
Bit different into everything, into cold calling, into email outreach, into how we do the videos, how do we bring their world to ours and then our world to theirs? It's such an applicable concept. Yeah. 

Speaker 5
I mean, education will change completely with the use of AI. You can bring such a higher level of education to underprivileged kids. You don't have to fly out the best PhD lecturer, you can just upload a chat GPT guy. So yeah, I'm really looking forward to being part of the transition towards AI and education and seeing how that all falls together. 

Speaker 1
Oh yeah, it's very exciting and I think we're very well positioned for that. In interest in experience, from pages wild amount of experience in the field and having seen so many layers of it, from what is being a teacher to what is being a parent who has a child who is getting educated, to being the child who is getting educated and what is working and what isn't, and the system that her organization has developed, the level of comprehension of what goes in the brains and how the outside stimuli gets processed. What actually is learning is incredible, just so you get a glimpse of what the hell we're talking about. You said what worked with the economist was you explained to him with words, you showed it to him and then he was able to play with it. 

Speaker 1
So he engaged the three channels that we have to process information. The auditory, because heard your words, the visual, because you showed it. And the most important one, man, the kinesthetic, where he could actually have it in his hands and feel it, do it, do the thing, because if we hear it and see it, we'll have an image of it, we'll be able to remember it. But what's the impact? Where's the aha moment in looking at it, in listening about it? It's doing it that brings the aha moment. So in cold calling, how can we integrate the three when we only get audio? How can we help them create a picture? Sure. Understand their pain points and stuff, but create a picture of the outcome. 

Speaker 1
Create a picture for them in their minds of, oh, this is what it would look like to have all these things running smoothly or to not have this problem anymore. This is what it would feel like to be able to not have to hit HR about this one policy and how this would apply to whatever these clients or these communications or whatever. Oh, I can just ask the question to the system that we have. So this is all very still, very abstract because we've yet to solidify the vision of what the product is. The question here is what has worked and why is it that it works? When we engage the three channels, the listening to it, the looking at it, which a video does, and then the third one, which is call to action, actually doing it. 

Speaker 1
Hey, and in the description is the Jupyter notebook, is the Google Colab. Just click on and just run all the cells. 

Speaker 5
As you say that. One of the reasons I like deep learning AI is you go on the thing and you've got the video there and you've got the notebook there and you're doing it at the same time. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
So the foundations of what resonates with people, for example, engaging the three channels of information is where we have to start from for anything that we do and have fun with it. How would that look like for emails? Because we talk about a lot about, like, we talk a lot in emails, but how can we help them create pictures about what we do without mentioning AI, without mentioning chat bots? And how can we help them create a feeling of what it would be like to have what we sell the challenge. Without mentioning AI, without mentioning chat bots? Talk about impact, talk about remembering, talk about feeling. Oh, yeah, I do want to reply to this person. 

Speaker 5
Well, then our testimonials will be great to show this is how X felt when they had it. 

Speaker 1
You're already catching on. Yeah. Where do we start prioritizing, reprioritizing and removing the fluff. Again, if it was just the three of us, how much would we had to eliminate from all of our plates? Writing blogs on LinkedIn is out. Long form content is out. We don't have the bandwidth for that. But it's not just the three of us. We have Kuba, we have Avi to some capacity. We have Powell and we have Bartech to some capacity. Okay, great. And that's how we can have the level ups, what they see, what they can do, that us three can't do. But let's still minimize and focus on what's effective and what leads us to our outcome. First client. And we're going to have to be patient. We're going to have to be patient because we could be cold calling all day. 

Speaker 1
And what do we sell when we're cold calling? We have less clarity on that. So development needs a focus. Content needs a focus. Marketing needs a focus. Let's make sure we're doing the effective activities. Money making activities. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, there's something that reminds me of the 80 20 rule. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
I agree. 

Speaker 3
Also one of the Singapore partner, our new Singapore partner, he went out and started his own company, basically helping people build their brands and make money. And he walked us through this very quickly. High level overview of the methodology that he used. 

Speaker 1
I'm looking it up. It includes virtual event. Live event is the last part. And the first one is. The first one are. 

Speaker 3
Brand like your brand. 

Speaker 1
It had a very simple logic to it so we can figure it out. It's videos online which help define the brand. So content online, that was brand. Then there's a second one, then it's virtual event. Like a live virtual conference for example, or a workshop that's live and out there. Community, brand, community, virtual event, live event. Let's scratch live event for now. But that process creates such a simple framework. We have brand, so the content that we have some way to engage with them through some sort of community. And then a virtual event and it all builds up on each other. And that's what works nowadays. That sure worked ten years ago, but there's a lot of things that worked ten years ago that don't work now. Like having a website and expecting people to pay for your thing nowadays. 

Speaker 1
But it used to ten years ago. So the level of sophistication is higher and the level of variety that creates credibility is higher. It used to be just having a nice website. It's credibility enough nowadays, no? So step one, content. Step one, shorts. We have stuff to do off of shorts for. We have hell of stuff to do shorts for. Think about each product that we have. We have our story. You just mentioned what you learned, which if we can talk about it for, if you can chunk it into five important things of 40 seconds each, that's a week worth of content, dude, that we can bang out in an hour. It doesn't need to be perfect. We just have to have a bit of a script. 

Speaker 5
You know what would be interesting? Do you remember that tool I said, the one that's designed for podcasts and it clips up all podcasts. You could throw in some of the recordings of this and just out the clips that it froze out. 

Speaker 1
I think that's a great idea. What was it called? 

Speaker 5
I want to say Miro, but it's not Miro. Miro is something else. Opus pro opus. 

Speaker 1
Okay. The only thing I'm thinking about is let's make sure that we create. 

Speaker 3
A. 

Speaker 1
Story so there's a lot that we can take out of all the recordings that we have. And if we're talking about quality, it means preparation. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. What I do if we're talking story is we need to set it up so that we explain everything and where we're at up until now. And then we do weekly or biweekly updates. 

Speaker 1
You mean for building in public specifically. 

Speaker 5
Or just in general building the company in public? Not just building certain projects, building the whole company in public. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. So now we're talking about getting together, the three of us, and just talking about faster eyes. How has everything happened? What Aha moments have we had over the last five months? Four months. And that's number one, going to help us with the master system prompt about who we are and also get content for shorts about what we're about. So for shorts we have kind of like faster story, deep learning AI course we have projects till now which we can just show as demos. We can do a demo for each of the projects. And when I say that the stuff that we learned and the stuff that we'll be going through goes really deep, we're talking about different frameworks that we have that very simple allow you to have define your objective. 

Speaker 1
And then what is each thing, each segment, each sentence that happens before that gets you closer to that objective. For example, through this demo, the objective of this content of this 1 minute video is for the person watching it to briefly understand what we're about, see the quality of what we can build, and understand the vision of what we'll be able to build. So who we are, what we built, and the vision of what we can build. The challenge is in less than 1 minute. So that's what we're talking about. Gamifying. Gamify the fuck out of that. You have 30 seconds. Telling the fasterized story too much. You don't leave time for the demo. Bring it down to ten. 

Speaker 5
Also, how much the thing is with the company story, I'm not sure how much we want to say, because what if it's because I like being able to. For example, you can hide behind the fact that all your developers didn't come from some random discord channel. And that you can pretend that they are actual developers or, I don't know, there's pros and cons to putting everything not public, I guess. 

Speaker 1
Very good question. Very good observation. What I'm talking about is let's just talk within ourselves. Let's figure out what the story has been so far and then we'll figure out what we put out there. I think we all need clarity on like. Yeah, this has been the story so far to then align on what comes next. 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. So let's schedule that for this week and we can sit down for an hour and talk within each of not. We have not. Henry, what did you ask? 

Speaker 5
I said we'll just have a timeline and we'll just go for it step by step and see if we can. 

Speaker 1
That's exactly right. We can have a timeline and then for fast rise story, we're talking about scheduling the time. Schedule time and create a timeline that'll help us structure it better. Good idea. We'll connect. We'll take this week to connect with everyone at faster ICE and also take some time in the coming week to clean up the discord. Because if it is six or seven of us, I want that to be very clear that it's six or seven of us and we'll know how much to simplify. So. So. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm. 

Speaker 5
I'm ready to get going. I think my next step would be just writing out what I'm doing and what focus blocks and then I'll just work, get it done. 

Speaker 3
I've got to do that too. And going to really just connect, reconnecting with people, especially the folks that have been on marketing, that nobody has the same consistent hours that we can meet. So it's been a lot of async. Anyways, we're going to start there. Also going to get some focus blocks and clear objectives of where we're going next. 

Speaker 1
And we will extra dig into ownership, we will extra dig into you own this now and this fails or succeeds on your shoulders, you're not in that day, it's still your responsibility. So find somebody who can do that thing, do that post that day, do whatever needs to happen to reach the right. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. I'm really happy. 

Speaker 3
Really good to be back. Good to see you again, Henry. 

Speaker 1
Good to see you, Henry. 

Speaker 5
Good to see you both. I missed you. Got quite bored at some point? 

Speaker 1
Yeah. Bad. Well, you'll be quite entertained this coming week. So what are the things you're doing? We're working on the next couple of days in the next 48 hours. 

Speaker 5
Yes. So main next 48 hours probably learn, finish learning what I want to teach and then writing out a plan to teach it. And then I've also got to look into instantly API. So I've got three things. So learn deep learning API, learn the course, teach the course, look into the instantly be. It might be easier. I just make like five YouTube videos and then we plug those into a tool and get clips out of them. 

Speaker 1
I'll help you on that. You know what's even easier? Let's have a conversation. We'll ask you questions. You tell us, we ask you questions. And then from there the nuggets come out. We don't want to make you have to think of every valuable thing in the course. Let's get curious together and then find the gold nuggets from there. Because we only get 1 minute. Sure, five videos, but 1 minute each. It's the in depth part that is most valuable. 

Speaker 5
I see. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
So honestly, I envision it as we build these videos that we will post. We do them together, we interact with each other. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I like that. 

Speaker 1
So instead of having to do three, four different times, we can do it together once. And then we bring it, and then. 

Speaker 3
We get good enough and turn it into a podcast. 

Speaker 1
Okay. Bam. 

Speaker 5
Then you guys already have a podcast. 

Speaker 3
We have one episode of podcast. 

Speaker 1
We have one episode. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Got to get more episodes of a podcast. 

Speaker 1
And we step into education. There are so many critical conversations of what works, what doesn't, what is just and what is unjust in the world of education. What is changing, how are things shifting? Because again, what we noticed the trainers, and we're talking decades of training that pages partners have decades of specialized training and coaching and facilitating. And they were like, we have to change the map right now because they were doing the event and these kids are not resonating with what usually works. That's something super interesting to talk about. Call it post COVID reasons, call it screens. And that's why, well, there are different branches. So we have so much to talk about in terms of podcasts that could call the attention of people that are in the field. It's like, oh, these guys can see the vision of what's changing. 

Speaker 1
And they also work in AI to adapt the world to this new changing changes in education. Those are the people I want to work with. So let's make sure that the content that we're putting out leads into this is what we're working on, which is the part of credibility and making it very relatable, simplified, relatable and it'll stick. 

Speaker 3
It'll stick. 

Speaker 1
Cool. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Thank you, Paige, for being here. 

Speaker 3
Thank you. 

Speaker 1
Thank you, Henry. 

Speaker 3
Thank you all for being here. 

Speaker 1
Let's. Let's keep going. 

Speaker 3
Let's keep going. 

Speaker 5
I'll speak tomorrow. I'll see you guys tomorrow. 

Speaker 1
See you tomorrow, brother. 

Speaker 3
Bye, Henry. Bye.
