Speaker 1
Fred at Fireflies is not joining for some reason.

Speaker 2
Oh, Fred.

Speaker 3
That's helpful.

Speaker 1
Cool. And leave the numbers to machines by the sea.

Speaker 3
I'm working on it. Now we have way more than four messages, so I'm trying to kind of.

Speaker 1
Cool. You want to share screen?

Speaker 3
Yeah, I got you here.

Speaker 1
Finding business emails address has proven to be a lot more annoying than I thought.

Speaker 3
Yeah. When you texted me that this morning, it gave me flashbacks because even when were using zoom info, the data just wasn't as accurate as you would hope for the amount that you pay Zoom info to give you that data.

Speaker 1
I see. And that's why I asked you for a manual. Two manual suggestions.

Speaker 3
Yeah, pretty much every real estate company I know of lists all their agents online, has all their contact information on their own website.

Speaker 1
So what did you think about the. Call me, talk to me.

Speaker 3
Yeah, I think obviously ton of experience. So he was super insightful.

Speaker 3
I totally agree with him that he likes it. It's good. That's awesome. We definitely have a lot of fluff in there that doesn't need to be there. So let's get rid of the fluff.

Speaker 1
Awesome.

Speaker 3
Is that.

Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah, perfect.

Speaker 1
One thing that he mentioned, which is a must, is all the subject lines are lowercase.

Speaker 3
It was synergy or synergy. Yeah, there was a couple, but that was one of them.

Speaker 1
Then let's do it the other way around because I'm sure it's incredibly tough to know which comments belong to what.

Speaker 3
Stop share.

Speaker 1
I was trying to catch as verbatim what he was saying.

Speaker 3
We want to help them feel this email is only for them. 

Speaker 2
It better be accurate. So I don't know if this is too much of a risk, given the lead list we're working with.

Speaker 1
There are a lot of AOL and MSN email addresses in there, and it makes me very nervous.

Speaker 3
Sure's my thought on that. I agree that if we're attempting to use that personal interaction of we saw you there, definitely, like Nico said, it has to be accurate and relevant.Speaker 1
Fair. 

Speaker 3
You know what I mean? 

Speaker 1
There's a lot of discourse about AI in the LinkedIn crowd. So if we then it will, in a counter way, be less likely that they're involved in the AI discourse. 

Speaker 3
Say that one more time. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, let me rephrase. In LinkedIn, there's a lot of conversation about AI. So if you are on LinkedIn, you've probably seen a lot of the conversation or taken part in some of the conversation, and that is part of our ICP, they are open and kind of relatively involved in one way or another. So if they are on LinkedIn and our email says LinkedIn, and they open the email and it's about connecting real estate and technology, then great. And if they are not in LinkedIn, then kind of in reverse. They're less likely to be involved in the AI conversation, which is thriving in LinkedIn. So if they're not in LinkedIn, they are likely less of our target, of our ICP, less close to us. 

Speaker 3
Right. But that right there immediately qualifies. Right. Because then we know if they're involved or not involved most. So that's, I think, a good place to go. Okay. Saw you on LinkedIn. Do I need to keep the hash marks here? 

Speaker 1
No, those are just for us to keep track of. 

Speaker 3
That's what I thought. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
But this is not a variable anymore. We're just using LinkedIn yeah. Saw you on LinkedIn. Found you on LinkedIn. Saw you on LinkedIn. Saw your LinkedIn. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I like that. 

Speaker 1
How many characters is that? Something like 40. I don't think we're going to get to the word synergies on their phone. 

Speaker 3
Maybe we flipped the sentence, thought we could find some synergies, saw your LinkedIn, something like that. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, let's do that. 

Speaker 3
We'll tweak the verbiage in a sec here, but at least put that at the beginning. 

Speaker 1
Fucking. 

Speaker 3
I spilled Red Bull on my keyboard. Now some of the keys stick. 

Speaker 1
That is so hilarious. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I got to pop them all off and clean the fucking receiver. I'm not doing that right now. 

Speaker 1
I'm happy to edit if it's more of a pain for you. 

Speaker 3
No, it's okay. It's only a few. It's mostly just commas. So if you see a long line of commas. 

Speaker 1
That's why you were so fucking jittery that you dropped your can. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, it was so cold and frosty, like a fresh beer. Right. I picked it up and it just slipped right out of my hand. 

Speaker 1
Oh, my God. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Okay. We have many others to go through. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, we got to be efficient here. Thought we could find some synergies. 

Speaker 1
Good copy paste. Oh, no, because we have all the messages, all the notes here. Okay, moving on. We're going to test this variable when we transfer, but let's keep going with the notes. I found some synergies with progressive folks in real estate, and I found your LinkedIn profile quite insightful. Enjoy discussing trends in the industry and cutting edge technology applications and cutting edge AI applications and newer and new AI apps. New tech apps. New technology apps. 

Speaker 2
What about just cutting edge technology? 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Why say that if we mean AI? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I need some synonyms for this. 

Speaker 2
Cutting edge AI technology. 

Speaker 1
And cutting edge feels. Marketing. 

Speaker 2
Okay, I enjoy this. 

Speaker 3
Does. 

Speaker 2
Especially with the surge of AI. 

Speaker 1
Especially with everything new in AI. The surge? 

Speaker 2
Surge in AI technology. 

Speaker 1
Especially around new things in AI. Trying to keep it, like, simple. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, new things in AI. 

Speaker 1
Words to somebody. 

Speaker 2
I don't know if I like how new things sound. 

Speaker 3
I don't either. New tools. Yeah, I did that down here and we changed it to GPT. I mean, we're talking about GPT, right? So should we just say GPT? But it goes beyond that, technically. 

Speaker 1
New AI tools. 

Speaker 3
New AI tools. 

Speaker 1
That hits our ICP. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. New AI tools. 

Speaker 1
Cool. Let's go to our zoom coffee. Have a feeling we'll find some of our interests aligned and then we'll put the variable date. So if it's today, then are you available anytime this week? Are you available anytime next week? We can change, right. 

Speaker 3
Depending on the day. Like Thursday, Friday. You got to push to next week. But Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, you could do this week. 

Speaker 2
Have a feeling we'll find our interests a lot. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Cool. I'm going to copy paste. That looks weird, but we know what it is and we can change. Are you available anytime this week? Are you available anytime next week? 

Speaker 2
We'd be sending this out Thursday. 

Speaker 1
So if today is less than four, meaning Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I think that's what this means. Then are you available anytime this week? Otherwise, if it's Thursday Friday, are you available anytime next week? So if it's Thursday Friday, should we say, are you talk. Monday, Tuesday, work. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Monday. 

Speaker 3
What do you think of needs here? Sorry, go ahead. A Monday Tuesday. 

Speaker 1
Synergies. Right. Synergies. Interest. 

Speaker 3
Got it. Yeah, we're good. Monday or Tuesday? Monday, Tuesday. Yeah, I think Monday Tuesday is fine. 

Speaker 1
Third Friday. Oh, no, that's not the code. So if the thing in the brackets is the code and the thing outside the brackets is the words that would come out. So if today is less than four, which is forest. Thursday. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Cool. Awesome. Otherwise, Monday, Tuesday. Cool. What is a better format? Because we're not really going for the super formal, but I think casual. 

Speaker 3
Mun twos. There's fry. I mean, we're in the US, there shouldn't be any confusion of what we mean. 

Speaker 1
Cool. Dope. Sick. Cool. 

Speaker 3
All right, I'm going to copy this into instantly. Are you ready for me to do that? 

Speaker 1
Yeah, great idea. 

Speaker 2
Let's do it. 

Speaker 1
Let's do it. 

Speaker 3
Perfect. 

Speaker 1
Fucking abro. What's wrong with me? 

Speaker 3
I think you need sleep. 

Speaker 1
That's the problem I can probably fuck with. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, you can. So I'm going to let you do that's. Wait, refresh that page because I have a B on there that you don't have. 

Speaker 1
You have to click save on anything. 

Speaker 3
Okay. I haven't saved it yet. That makes sense. 

Speaker 1
Super annoying. It shouldn't be that way. Variables. Come on, give me other code. View preview. 

Speaker 3
Hold on. Try to refresh the page again because I just saved synergies. There should be a whole message there. There we go. 

Speaker 1
Synergies. 

Speaker 3
We'll change. Juggling the chaos in a minute, but cool. 

Speaker 1
We will work on that one. And. Come on. There has to be a way. I'm going to look up two things. In the meantime, let's jump to the next email yeah. 

Speaker 3
So, variation two. We're leaving as it is right now because that'll be a swap for a. But let's go to message two. 

Speaker 1
How to add tagline to email. Done. Yeah. Okay, so, time and day, variable. Bam. Fine. Now, case, handle. Went Monday. It's Monday. When? Tuesday. Hello. Tuesday, I. Wednesday. Happy Monday. Happy day of the week. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I like that. 

Speaker 2
Put it there. And it's Friday. Will it double happy. 

Speaker 1
Right. Very good question. So then we go to the things that are not in brackets and we say. That's what we want to say. We would say, happy Monday, happy Tuesday, happy Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Cool. But you wouldn't really say happy Tuesday. Yeah, fuck it. I always do that. 

Speaker 3
Actually, I do too. 

Speaker 1
Prime of the brain. 

Speaker 2
Then why discriminate against. 

Speaker 1
It? Gets closer to Wednesday and nobody wants to be in a Wednesday. 

Speaker 3
Maybe. Hello and happy. Do we have that already, or hello and happy. Yeah, like, hello and Happy Monday. 

Speaker 1
Hello and Happy Monday. We can, if you want. 

Speaker 3
Just an idea. I got a list of a few. In them. 

Speaker 1
Less words the better. We can try it. I'm not sure. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, no. Less words the better. Happy day of the week. As long as you guys are fine with that. I'm fine with it. 

Speaker 1
I know it's the week. Will the campaign run over the weekend? That was your question. And he wrote something, right. Where was it? Page. 

Speaker 3
He did. 

Speaker 1
It was Nico message, had a meeting. I'm happy. 

Speaker 3
I know it's the weekend, but I'm excited to see your profile changes. 

Speaker 1
Where is that? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I found it in. 

Speaker 1
Oh, wait, a different version of it, remember? Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Oh, it's at the bottom, I think. The only thing I have that he wrote is Nico message. 

Speaker 1
This one. Hey, John, please don't answer to Monday. 

Speaker 3
Okay. 

Speaker 1
And then we worked on it and it was like, I know it's the weekend. And that was so I think. 

Speaker 2
We were talking about using relevant Google, the address, and find coffee shops or local places in the areas where they work to relate with them. I don't know how much we actually dug into the copy. 

Speaker 3
Oh. 

Speaker 1
Okay. So let's go over the copy then. He said, there is a way for certain emails to be sent only on certain days, certain variations to be sent only on certain days. 

Speaker 3
He did say that. Don't know if he explained how, but. 

Speaker 1
He sent me this document that should say, how cool. Based on day of the week greetings, based on the week meetings, based on the week, inserting the day of the week, inserting yesterday's date. 

Speaker 2
Is it. 

Speaker 3
Still here? Listening. I'll be back in 2 seconds. 

Speaker 1
He made it sound like an email will not be sent unless it's like a day of the week that you assigned. But what I showed him is like, well there is no option for that. You can schedule it, but there's also no option for which schedule to use. It's either this one or that one. And that was like strange. Insert link more text templates. Maybe add step strange. Okay, let's just move on. Spin tax creating variations of sentences or words random. Okay, cool. If you try to set the variables day. Okay, well, code view now at the bottom what this line does. Variable position. You can also. Okay, well maybe for the next one. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I just googled it. It seems like we need to do a few more steps. 

Speaker 1
So let's table that we can go with this. We remove that. I got excited when I saw your LinkedIn profile and noticed a lot of palace we both work on. Good to find things that they resonate with, I. E. That we're both interested on and noticed a lot of notice. 

Speaker 2
A lot of parents. 

Speaker 1
Oh, right. And the next sentence is we're in the real estate space and I'm really into new technology. You have to decide on we or I. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
What do you guys think? I like the Wi. 

Speaker 1
And really into music knowledge. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I generally like wi. I'm trying to think about. 

Speaker 3
The Wi sounds too generic to what are they trying to sell? 

Speaker 1
But that's just to me. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, maybe I is more personal. That's true. 

Speaker 2
Notice a lot of parallels. Cut that sentence there. I got excited when I saw your LinkedIn profile and noticed a lot of parallels, period. I'm also in the real estate space. I'm really into new technology. I'd love to understand how you're utilizing chat GPT today. Love to, love to meet to discuss how you are. 

Speaker 1
Discuss understand chat about. We'd love to meet and discuss. We'd love to meet and chat about. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I like chat. But then we're using chat GPT, so you can't use the same word twice. 

Speaker 1
And yeah. Understand how you're using chat GPT today. I like it today. And then you go into Wednesday, Thursday, how you're using chgbt I would be sending. That's what you meant. 

Speaker 3
Cool, that's good. Unless you want to do the testing swap here. Do you want to try doing the same thing we did for the first one with the subject line and the tagline where you're using the word in the first phrase? You know what I mean? Or do you want to test it in that we're not using lifestyle automations or whatever our subject line is in the first sentence. 

Speaker 1
Yes, that's a great idea. Let me remember how to do that. I think it's this one. Now at the bottom of your email, just add this line display non you don't display it and you show the words that you want to say. I think that's how it went. So you go div. So HTML display is don't show this when you actually show the email, but it does show up. This is the tagline, this is the email header. What do they call it? 

Speaker 3
Subject line? 

Speaker 1
No, email preview. 

Speaker 3
Okay, that makes sense. 

Speaker 1
So you go into code. Okay, wonderful. I know it's the weekend, I got excited. No, I got excited when I saw your LinkedIn profile and noticed a lot of parallels. I'm also in the real estate space and really into new technologies. Love to connect and understand how you're using chat. GPT does Thursday sound good? Does day of the week? And we say the same thing. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. 

Speaker 3
Yes. 

Speaker 1
Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, work sound good? And cta alternative, let's not do alternatives right now. 

Speaker 3
No, that was just, yeah, delete it, you're good. 

Speaker 1
Have a productive, have a productive week. What if it's like Friday, we can do the same code and say, yeah. 

Speaker 3
I was going to say sub for have a great weekend. Yeah, hope you enjoy the weekend. 

Speaker 1
Have a good start of the week. Rest of the week. Have a good rest of the week. Have a productive start of the week. 

Speaker 3
This is for Friday. 

Speaker 1
Friday. Then what do we say? And what if it's Monday because we're sending these during weekdays, so could we. 

Speaker 2
Set it to Friday? Have a great weekend. And if it's any other day, have a great week. 

Speaker 1
Good, have a great rest of your week. Yeah, okay, cool. If it's less than five, then have a great rest of your week. Have a good, or great, I think great rest of your week. Great weekend. Alejo from faster rice and we put the number. 

Speaker 3
Perfect. 

Speaker 1
Cool, lovely. Let's paste it in. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I want to see where you're pasting this in because this is going to be the sub for a right variant or. 

Speaker 1
Oh, it doesn't really let me. 

Speaker 3
Variables at the bottom. What is that? No, that's not it. 

Speaker 1
Oh, did it just die on me? Don't. What's our tagline on this? Lifestyle automations. Having fun automating my life? 

Speaker 2
We'Re connecting it to the subject line and in this version we're not mentioning automation otherwise. 

Speaker 3
Right. So then we got to say something about parallels. 

Speaker 1
A lot of parallels. Let me make it easier to see. 

Speaker 2
I think we. 

Speaker 1
Cool parallels lifestyle automations understand or learn about would love to connect and learn about how you're using. 

Speaker 3
Chgt lifestyle parallels we don't necessarily need automations but I don't know if I like lifestyle parallels. 

Speaker 1
Cool automations. 

Speaker 3
Real estate parallels. 

Speaker 1
Real estate automations no, lifestyle automations is our offer. 

Speaker 3
It is. 

Speaker 1
We can do variations and just do the subject line as the variation. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. So let's say it is lifestyle automations. What is the tagline? 

Speaker 3
I got excited when I saw your LinkedIn profile and noticed you may be using lifestyle automations. Noticed you may be in need of now they can't put the offer that soon. 

Speaker 1
Noticed you had something there. 

Speaker 3
You may be using lifestyle automations. 

Speaker 1
Using lifestyle automations question mark. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
To. 

Speaker 2
How we're seeing lifestyle automation. 

Speaker 1
To. Is it a question? It is a question. How you're using lifestyle automations. How are you using lifestyle automations? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, phrase it as a question. I got excited when I saw your profile and would like to know how you're using or am curious about how you're using lifestyle automations. 

Speaker 1
So this is for the tagline. This is like 30. 

Speaker 3
Oh yeah. Okay, I got you. 

Speaker 1
Are you using lifestyle curious about lifestyle parallels curious. 

Speaker 3
Curious how you're using. 

Speaker 1
Curious about your lifestyle automations curious. 

Speaker 3
How you're using or. 

Speaker 1
Curious how you're using lifestyle automations? Let's go. 

Speaker 3
That might be too many. Is that too many characters about curious. 

Speaker 1
About your lifestyle automations? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, that should work. 

Speaker 1
Cool. Let's hope it works. We can. Zach, let's try mine. 

Speaker 3
So you can do mine too. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. Since I'm sharing screen just yeah. 

Speaker 2
Yes. 

Speaker 1
Thank you for the attention to detail. Oh fuck yeah. 

Speaker 2
Cool. 

Speaker 1
That's fucking awesome. 

Speaker 3
Beautiful. 

Speaker 1
Okay. And my phone. Let's see my phone. 

Speaker 3
Friday. Lois for you with that. 

Speaker 1
Apple. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. Interesting. 

Speaker 1
Automation. The N and the S don't come up but that's okay. 

Speaker 3
Automation. 

Speaker 1
Curious about your last? It's just about. It's two, four, 68, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 28. About 35 characters is what? The lowest it goes. Which is about. 

Speaker 3
Okay, stay on your email for 1 second. Quick detour, but not really. Click what Nico mentioned not using any capital letters. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Can you explain? I'm, I'm curious. 

Speaker 1
Absolutely. Because of this. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. Two spammy promotions. Yeah. Social updates. Okay, I got you. Everybody does that. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, everybody does capital letters. 

Speaker 3
Okay. Perfect. Question answered. We're good. 

Speaker 1
He can hear you better. Maybe they're charged now, so maybe I can put them on. Yeah, I just want to make sure they can hear you. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I can only hear bits and pieces. 

Speaker 2
Okay, cool. 

Speaker 3
Perfect. All right, we're good. 

Speaker 1
Back to now. 

Speaker 2
Fix the space. Going to bother me. Okay, I think you can fix it in the regular email preview. It's in between the second and third paragraph. There's an extra space. That's the first paragraph. Yes, I. It's underneath the I got excited paragraph. There's an extra space. 

Speaker 3
It might be two extra spaces. 

Speaker 2
Yes. Because when you look back at how it came through in your email, the spacing is not consistent. It's visually distracting. Well, click into the right. I'm not with you anymore. I see perplexity giving an error. 

Speaker 3
I don't have. Think your buds died. 

Speaker 2
Oh, Zach can't hear you. Miamore. Okay, you can hear me? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I got you. 

Speaker 2
Okay. Too much zoom. Got the zoom. Zoomies. 

Speaker 1
Hear me now? You can hear me. 

Speaker 3
There we go. I got you. Fuck, I lost you again. 

Speaker 2
We can just go. No headphones and I'll turn my volume off. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. If you can hear me through his, then that works. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
If you can make sure you have the mega sound cancellation on. Yay. I don't know why it's been so weird like that. Okay, moving on. Else. Great weekend. Can you hear us twice whenever you want to speak. Then just. You can unmute that. Have a great weekend. Let's see how that came out in the email. Monday. 

Speaker 3
Test that. I'm going to start looking at the next message. 

Speaker 1
Beautiful. Short. Nice. 

Speaker 3
Beautiful. 

Speaker 1
Okay, cool. Done. Saved lifestyle automations. Yay. I'm going to start which spaces? Oh, yeah. No, we're getting there. Div and Div goes in. Div and Div. Thought we could find some synergies. 

Speaker 2
Just checking that the name isn't all going to turn out John, because it looks like it's outside the script. 

Speaker 1
Thank you. Yes. Morning. Afternoon. Evening. Morning. I don't know who thinks 04:00 p.m. Is evening, but afternoon, evening. These are great. Okay. I've found synergies with progressive. This is a politicized word. What do we change it for? 

Speaker 3
Greed. 

Speaker 1
With. 

Speaker 3
Forward thinking. 

Speaker 1
Forward thinking is a little too marketing. Maybe with modern savvy. 

Speaker 3
Savvy. 

Speaker 1
Also too marketing. 

Speaker 3
It's a little marketing. My synonyms are too politically charged. Let's see. 

Speaker 1
I've found synergies. Doesn't quite. I've had good conversations. We're talking about synergies. 

Speaker 3
Open minded. 

Speaker 1
We are going. That is one of our ICP characteristics. 

Speaker 3
Doesn't seem too marketing. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. I found good synergies with open minded folks in real estate. And I found your LinkedIn profile quite insightful. Pager profile discussing trends in the industry and new AI tools. Connect to our zoom coffee. Have a feeling we'll find our interest line. Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, work. Enjoy the rest of your week. Perfect weekend. Enjoy the rest of the week. Okay, cool. And we call that done. 

Speaker 3
We've said synergy, synergies so many times. I'm like, should it be plural or should it just be synergy? I found good synergy with open minded folks. I've found good synergies with open minded folks. 

Speaker 1
Find some synergies. Well, it could be either in this one, but we are expressing some. I know that technically the term is synergy. Synergy is. 

Speaker 3
Even if it's multiple, it could be plural or singular. I see what you're saying. Synergies is fine then in that scenario, that makes sense. 

Speaker 1
Synergy is dynamic rather than how many things you align on. 

Speaker 3
Got it. 

Speaker 1
That's semantically in use. People use synergies. Okay, good synergy with open minded folks. Let's move on. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, let's move on. That's cool. I'm in. Juggling the chaos. Just let me save this and then refresh your page. And I put two messages in here because one is the one we started with at the top, and then the one at the bottom is Nico's. You're good to go. I just want to whittle down the one we created to be closer to Nico's. I feel like his is a little short and ours is a little long, so we need to meet somewhere in the middle. 

Speaker 1
Oh, shit. It didn't save. I was sure I hit save, motherfucker. Dude, are you kidding me? What the fuck? Because you refreshed it. 

Speaker 3
I refreshed my page. All right, let's only have one person in here. I'm getting out. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, let's do that then. 

Speaker 3
Doesn't act like Google. It's not helpful. 

Speaker 1
I hope that it would. We're going to copy that over. We know exactly what we're changing. Enjoy. 

Speaker 2
The rest of your week. And then. 

Speaker 1
Yes, the rest of your week. Enjoy your weekend. Great, then. Thought we could find some synergies. Saw your LinkedIn saving code view. 

Speaker 3
In the second paragraph. We got to change. Hold on. Yeah, the parentheses, I've found synergies right below. That's think. 

Speaker 1
That's how it goes. 1212 a okay, what is it? 

Speaker 3
Down one paragraph? Yes, right there where you have. I've found synergies with progressive folks. I just put those parentheses there before. 

Speaker 1
But found good synergy. We said found. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Yes. 

Speaker 1
I found good synergy with open minded folks in real estate. And I found your LinkedIn page profile. 

Speaker 2
Now we have found twice in the same sentence. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. Was it found? Thought I've. 

Speaker 2
What was it? 

Speaker 1
I've. 

Speaker 2
Had good synergy with open minded focus real estate, and I found a link for about works. 

Speaker 1
I enjoy discussing trends in the industry and UA tools. Connect over a zoom coffee path, feeling we'll find an interest, align Thursday, Friday. 

Speaker 3
Monday, Tuesday, come across, whatever, doesn't matter. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, we can distill this forever. 

Speaker 3
It's fine. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Thought we could find some synergies. Saw your LinkedIn and it saves. And now if I go back, we modify this. Good. This is the 17, so 05:00 p.m.. Good. Now we save. And now if I refresh. Love it. Twelve. Okay. Otherwise it's evening. Let's kind of go over some coffee. I've had good synergy. We open my folks in real estate, I find your LinkedIn qualifying further. Let's move on. 

Speaker 3
Yes. 

Speaker 1
Hey, subject line, juggling the chaos. Is it to marketing? Is it like, oh, is this a newsletter? 

Speaker 3
Maybe getting rid of the just juggling chaos. 

Speaker 1
Cool. 

Speaker 2
And I think this was the one where he said, just cut out that initial line about us because they don't care about us. Let's keep it about them. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. And what did we change it for? 

Speaker 2
I think we cut it. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, I said so. 

Speaker 3
In that same message, I copy and pasted his. 

Speaker 1
We haven't gone over all the comments. That's right. So time of day formula. He said to keep it simple. Keep simple. Include personalization about every remotely associated marketing terms, which, like juggling. So he just said, let me know. Keep it super simple. I'm happy to test because this does talk about juggling the chaos, but this is a call to action, and it's pretty cool. We could decide to a B test just that subject line and maybe put a tagline like figuring out how to deal with chaos. Okay, so next time of day formula. They don't care about us. It's not about us. They care about what we can do for them, only care about them. Had a meeting with an agent last week for coffee, but she forgot to. This is somewhere else below. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I put it right instantly. Already. I copied that whole thing. It's in the thing. 

Speaker 1
A call to action. Let me know if variable date works for you. Cool. 

Speaker 3
For this message, can we think about like, in the back of our minds, the female ICP coming from a female email address and designing for female recipients. I don't know if that's. 

Speaker 1
Then we could only send from page ad email. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I'm just thinking, I don't know if we can't now because we can't choose. 

Speaker 1
No, we can address it. 

Speaker 3
Okay, so then we could choose to only send to females. Interesting. 

Speaker 1
Okay, yeah. Cool. Good call. Let's see. So, good morning, afternoon, evening. First, are you said this was the one, right? That you copy pasted? 

Speaker 3
Yes, that was Nicos. Had a meeting with an agent last week. Coffee, blah, blah, CTA, all that. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, had a meeting with angel last week. Her coffee. She forgot to set a calendar for the meeting. Let's be honest. Well done, this. And it just doesn't feel good. We made Emma a solution with AI that makes sure it never happens again. Happy to explain what we did for her to see if you could benefit from it too. Let me know if I'd be happy to show you how. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I like that line. 

Speaker 1
And this is the variation. That's right, this is the variant. Okay. Page from faster ICE. From faster ICE. We are copying, we are saving. We are getting her phone number. Oh, that was dangerous. 

Speaker 3
It was dangerous. 

Speaker 1
I was getting nervous, but it's fine, it's been synchronized. I'm going to make sure that as I'm working on something, I at least have like save. Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Just take a breath and slow down a minute. 

Speaker 1
Thank you. We just have a lot more to go through. 

Speaker 2
I know. 

Speaker 1
Had a meeting with an agent last week for coffee. Had a meeting with an agent, Emma, last week for coffee. Because we are mentioning Emma here. 

Speaker 3
We should be mentioning real estate too, right? 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Sorry, what page? 

Speaker 2
I'm thinking about pros and cons of saying someone's name or referring to her. 

Speaker 3
Right. 

Speaker 1
Nico seems pretty keen on the idea. It makes it a lot more tangible and human. And it's true, it's just we're not saying Devon for obvious reasons. 

Speaker 3
Right. I just changed the name. Yeah. Emma is the most liked female name in the United States, by the way. I checked. 

Speaker 1
Oh, fascinating. But what is your concern? 

Speaker 2
That someone might think you're blowing up someone else's story, like privacy kind of thing, but that's not really based on anything other than a thought. 

Speaker 1
It's good that we're not, but we are. Does it break our celery test? 

Speaker 2
No, I think I'm thinking about hypersensitive people. I don't think it breaks our celery test at all. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Awesome. Great. Thank you for that comment. Let's move on, then. But, yes, very important that we keep asking ourselves that question. I don't know if we told you about the celery test, Zach. 

Speaker 3
You haven't. 

Speaker 1
But I. Another day can infer. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, another day. 

Speaker 1
Let's be honest. We've all done this. That doesn't feel good. Anything we should change here other than this? I can get the. 

Speaker 3
I think it's good. Short, straight to the point. I mean, synthesize the story. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, great. Cool. So few things that we're doing here. Afternoon, evening, had a meeting. Let me know if day. I'll be happy to show you. We are keeping this here then. And what we're doing right now is the variable. So let me know if certain day works. We did let me know if this. Let me know if works for you. Patreon. Faster. ICE. Okay, now copying. We're leaving. We're coming back. We're checking. Okay, great. It's there. We're leaving. We're doing tagline. Because we don't have a tagline for that yet. 

Speaker 3
Right. 

Speaker 1
So coming back. Dookie. We're still good. We're going code. We are pasting. What is our tagline? Balls in the air. Some balls in our hands, some balls in the air. That could fit in 40 characters. How many women? Only two ovaries. 

Speaker 3
Nico's point with juggling chaos being marketing related does make this more difficult, because I want to talk about how do you juggle the chaos? How do you manage the chaos? How do you juggle the work? That kind of thing. But all those taglines seem too marketing track of everything. 

Speaker 2
How do you keep track of it all? 

Speaker 1
Keeping track. 

Speaker 3
Keeping track of it all? Yeah. 

Speaker 1
How do you keeping track of it? Keep track of all of it? Of it? All of all of it? 

Speaker 2
How do you keep track of everything? 

Speaker 1
It? 

Speaker 3
How do you balance. 

Speaker 1
How do you balance everything? How do you keep track? Keep track is the offer that we're selling here. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
How do you keep track of everything? Yeah. Cool. 

Speaker 2
This could be a really good a B test. Everything is the same, except the subject line is. Quick question. 

Speaker 1
The one that Nico had said specifically for this one was let me know name. But he was just throwing that out. It was when were going through this example that he said, let me know name. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I feel like that could be applicable for anything to any of them. But because our tagline question, how do you keep track of everything? I'm just curious how that would sync up with. Subject line, quick question. And then the first thing I see is, how do you keep track of everything? 

Speaker 1
Subject line, quick question. How do you keep track of everything? 

Speaker 3
Let me know. 

Speaker 1
Emma, are we testing juggling chaos? 

Speaker 3
Sure. Let's do it. 

Speaker 1
Cool. And then that allows us to go a B test. This, too? 

Speaker 3
Yes. 

Speaker 1
It's not mixing the A B test because one is open rate and the other one is reply rate. They won't see this before they open. Okay, cool. So I'm going to save, I'm going to go here, I'm going to code, I'm going to paste this, and I'm going to go back. So now we grab this part. 

Speaker 2
You only need one of those. 

Speaker 1
Save. Yes. I just want to make sure that this is pasted. This is nice. We still have this. How you keep track of everything. Great. Moving on. And now I'll be happy to show you. Yes, we only need one of these. Happy to explain. 

Speaker 2
We just need to pick one. 

Speaker 1
So in the other one. So we have been three variations of this, right? Is that what we're. Okay. I'll be happy to show you how Emma and her team are using it to save themselves a lot of headaches. 

Speaker 2
To prevent future headaches. 

Speaker 1
Prevent. 

Speaker 3
What about using automate to marketing? 

Speaker 1
Yeah. You hop on a call later this week to see if we can do the same for you. Show you how Emma and her team are using it to. 

Speaker 2
Stay organized. 

Speaker 1
Stay organized and productive. Yeah, it's a little generic. I'll be happy to show you how Emma and her team are using it to. 

Speaker 2
We just say it. 

Speaker 1
Never let anything slip. To always keep track. 

Speaker 2
To make sure nothing slips through the cracks. 

Speaker 1
Yes. Dream outcome. Are we declaring the negative or are we declaring the positive? 

Speaker 3
Put that down first and then we'll. Using it to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. Right. Happy share. I'm entertainment. Using it to make sure nothing. 

Speaker 1
Let's be honest, we've all done this and it feels awful. Not just that it doesn't feel good. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I want that to hit harder, too. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I agree. 

Speaker 1
Different paragraphs or one sentence after the other. 

Speaker 2
I kind of like those separate the way they are. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Is it too much to say Emma and her team are using it to transform text messages into Google? Just name the automation in a succinct. 

Speaker 1
Like Alex for mostly screaming at me. They don't care about the how. They only care about the outcome. So what is the outcome? The outcome is like avoiding headaches. The outcome is saving time. The outcome is to keep track, which. 

Speaker 3
Is naturally created events. Hold on. That's what I liked about our message. It was too wordy, but it had a lot of detail. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. It's like I'm making sure that I don't miss anything. With less effort. 

Speaker 1
To keep track of everything with no effort. How Emma and her team are using it to keep track of everything without to. The tagline is, how do you keep track of everything? How do we look back around? We use the same words, or do you use synonyms? 

Speaker 2
How Emmett and our team now spend less time. Are spending less time. No. 

Speaker 3
Juggling the chaos. 

Speaker 2
Emma and her team. 

Speaker 1
Well, they're already open the email. 

Speaker 3
Right. 

Speaker 1
We talked a lot about. 

Speaker 2
Right. And I guess this subject line will be. Quick question. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. So using it to juggle the chaos. 

Speaker 3
No more juggling the chaos. Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Because juggling the chaos is chaotic. You don't want to be juggling. 

Speaker 3
Right. 

Speaker 1
Using it to not have to juggle the chaos too much. 

Speaker 2
Double negative. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Happy to share. 

Speaker 3
To eliminate juggling the chaos. It's a little too marketing, but let's think of another word. 

Speaker 2
Show you how Emma and her team have eliminated the chaos. 

Speaker 1
We are talking about the awful feelings. So I could see how instead of dream outcome, it's like, let's prevent this from happening. Okay, well, we also have this variation, so we can do this third email with this third call to action, and then just, like, we can try both. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, just same thing. 

Speaker 1
Make sure nothing slips through the cracks. Are you using it to manage the chaos? What did you say? 

Speaker 2
Using it to eliminate the chaos. 

Speaker 1
Eliminate the chaos. 

Speaker 2
It's all smooth sailing now. Very salesy. 

Speaker 1
Using it to eliminate juggling the chaos. To make sure nothing slips through the cracks. Let's vote. 

Speaker 3
I like eliminating the juggling of the. 

Speaker 2
Chaos, using it to the way Zach phrased it was. Are using it to eliminate juggling the chaos. How do you eliminate the chaos? 

Speaker 1
Having to juggle the chaos. Eliminate. 

Speaker 2
Happy to show you how Emma and her team are using it. No more juggling the chaos. 

Speaker 3
I'll be happy to show you how Emma and her team are using it. No more juggling the chaos, period. 

Speaker 1
Cool. Moving on. Let me know if Tuki dookie works for you. Had a meeting with an agent. Quick question. First name. 

Speaker 2
This might be a little nitpicky, but would we want to say, hey, first name, comma, quick question. 

Speaker 3
I do like the name being right up there in the beginning, because in most of the marketing emails, I have my name is not in there, but if my name is in there it gets my attention. 

Speaker 1
Cool. Then I'm going to grab this code, copy it. I'm going to create a new variant and it looks weird because it's not in code view. Great. And then this variant is still first name. Quick question. Or the other way around. The other way around. 

Speaker 3
Yes. We could test two things there. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Comma or. 

Speaker 2
Nah, not in that one. 

Speaker 1
Cool. Let's be honest, we all done this. Happy to hop on a call later this week. 

Speaker 2
No comma in that sentence. 

Speaker 1
To see if we can. 

Speaker 2
Happy to hop on a call later this week to see if we can do the same for you. 

Speaker 1
Happy to hop on a call. Happy to hop on a call. 

Speaker 2
Why don't you just take out, undo that real quick. Yeah, take out later this week there. Happy to call to see if we can do the same for you. Let me know if blank works. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, I suppose to jump. Putting it all in one. Why divide it in two? 

Speaker 2
Because if you put the schedule thing there, then you lose the end of the sentence. 

Speaker 1
Happy to hop on a call Monday or Tuesday to see if we can do this thing for you. 

Speaker 2
At least in my brain I get stuck on like oh, Monday, Tuesday doesn't work for me. And I don't finish reading the sentence. 

Speaker 1
Okay. 

Speaker 3
Right. They're almost like. Yeah, they're thinking about scheduling too early. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
One sentence after the other. Happy to hop on call to see if we can do the same for you. Emma. Let me know if Thursday Friday worked for you. 

Speaker 3
I think I like the space. Maybe just because of the codes there. 

Speaker 2
And I think I would capitalize the l there. 

Speaker 3
Cool, nice. 

Speaker 1
And that's that. 

Speaker 3
Run it. 

Speaker 1
Wow. Let me copy this fucking thing. I haven't even pulled for fucking leads. 

Speaker 2
One thing at a time. 

Speaker 1
One thing at a time. Yes, you are right wise. Very wise. Let's preview. 

Speaker 3
I like that. 

Speaker 2
Still with you just running to the bathroom. 

Speaker 1
Kate, quick question. Kate and page at transpired journey. That is not how we want to do it. We need to cancel the previous emails and buy new. Yeah, right now Nico has said it's not really an issue because we have all domains for our previous agency. 

Speaker 3
Got it. 

Speaker 1
And they come up with a whole email as opposed to name. So I'll fix that on our end. I am copying, I am saving and I'm moving on. I'll be happy to show you. Happy to hop. I'll be happy to show you. I'm going to show in the chaos. I am copying and I am saving. What I didn't check is how do you keep track of everything? Quick question. I am previewing and I am sent. Could you read this, Zach, and let me know if that looks good? I'm going to pee. Real? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, you're good. 

Speaker 1
That looks good on my end. Perfect. 

Speaker 3
Coffee. I'm just thinking of a couple, like, verbiage tweaks. I don't think we need the a coffee. I think we could just do last week for coffee. I want to change the second to. Let's be honest, we've all done this, and it's an awful feeling. I want to hit them with awful earlier. That's a good sentence. I'll. I want to change to I'd. I will. Or I would. I would be happy to show. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
How Emma and her team are using it. No more juggling the chaos and then capital L. Yeah, but that's it. Just like some minor tweaks. 

Speaker 2
Alejo, are you ready to edit? 

Speaker 1
We're getting comments on our LinkedIn post. 

Speaker 3
Nice. 

Speaker 2
Whose LinkedIn posts? 

Speaker 1
From one month ago. 

Speaker 2
I was like, I haven't posted on LinkedIn. I guess I'll try to. 

Speaker 1
It's pretty boted. One of them was bought and then I guess. Anyway, what was it? 

Speaker 3
Okay, so first sentence. Get rid of the A before coffee. You don't need that. 

Speaker 1
A first sentence. 

Speaker 3
At a meeting with an agent. Yes. Just delete that a. 

Speaker 1
Yes. 

Speaker 3
Perfect. That was one of the changes. The other one that a perfect second paragraph instead of. And it feels awful. I want to hit them with awful earlier. And it's an awful feeling. Yeah, because awful earlier in the sentence. Okay, perfect. Third paragraph. 

Speaker 1
Good. 

Speaker 3
Fourth paragraph instead of aisle. We'll do. I'd. I would. That's it. 

Speaker 1
I'm saving. Perfect. Copying this. And then. 

Speaker 3
All right, now I have to go pee. 

Speaker 1
Copying here. 

Speaker 2
We made happy to hop on a call to see if we can do the same for you. Let me know if this works. Okay. And happy to share or do we want to hit explain or do we share in a different version? Explain as I think a stronger connotation so we can stick with it. 

Speaker 1
Cool. I want to keep that there. 

Speaker 2
All I see is you moving your mouse around. 

Speaker 1
So we'll do some checks. We are checking for subject line tagline. 

Speaker 2
You found some synergies to all your LinkedIn. 

Speaker 3
Name. 

Speaker 1
Are we even mentioning their name? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, if you put a name in that tagline, I would put it as the first thing. 

Speaker 3
Yes. I was thinking that. 

Speaker 2
We'Re on the same page. 

Speaker 1
Fuck, yeah. Okay. So I am testing this email now. Anything to change. 

Speaker 3
Synergy with open minded folks in real estate. I found your LinkedIn profile quite insightful. Enjoy. 

Speaker 1
Site. 

Speaker 3
Discussing trend. 

Speaker 1
Let me do you guys a favor there. 

Speaker 3
Oh cool. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
These are on the same line. It's nice and short and it's two questions one line. Let's do this in a separate one. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, maybe next line. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Okay, I'm just gonna. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Good. 

Speaker 1
I'm just gonna go fix something so I can actually test this and see how the name comes up. Because I fucked this up last time and it sucked when it said like it was Alex inspired or something like that. It was bad. Your name is coming up here, man. Putting this gave us so much fucking, so much better deliverability. Absurd. Your name, your name. I don't know why it's not coming up in my email then. Because the whole email is coming up as name. But then if I go to Alex, it's also so strange. See what it. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, let me. What do you want it to say instead of Alex? 

Speaker 1
Well no, I wanted to say Paige and yours but it just shows the whole email. The second email. 

Speaker 2
Oh, the second email. 

Speaker 1
I want it to be like Alex. 

Speaker 2
Right. 

Speaker 3
But I'm thinking maybe it's because his email is Alexander and yours is page instead of what that would. 

Speaker 1
Very strange. Let's see. Getting spirit. Journey and page settings. 

Speaker 3
What if you changed page to like page p dot like page pwom. Just test to see if you put something else there if it's going to act the same. 

Speaker 1
I had my bowl. 

Speaker 2
I did that earlier. 

Speaker 1
It's your fault. Oh yeah, I was checking for preview and now I forgot which is the email I changed. Must be this one. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, it is page. 

Speaker 1
Okay, Kate Alejo. Let me know how it comes through. 

Speaker 2
No, it's still showing. 

Speaker 1
Wow, that's weird. So weird. Alex, what's the fucking difference? Fast track. Getting inspired. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, that's the only other thing I was thinking is change something in the last name. But I don't know. 

Speaker 2
You go to my account name. 

Speaker 1
Yes, one sec. Yes, let me try sending this with this new change from Alex page. Getting inspired. Journey AI. What did you want to check? 

Speaker 2
Email account. 

Speaker 1
Yes, same thing. 

Speaker 2
Go into the email. The account for the ones that have page in it. 

Speaker 1
Yes. 

Speaker 2
Oh, you were just there. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Weird. Show advanced settings. No. 

Speaker 1
Instantly name coming up as full email. Suddenly my full name appears and I will look address book email address instead of display name. Clinician sender name. No sender name signatures. It front signatures. It's just like coming right when it's coming right. So weird. Right? 

Speaker 3
When you did the last name P, did that change anything or. No, no, same thing. 

Speaker 1
Okay, I'm sure I can figure this out. Let's move on. 

Speaker 3
Okay, we have to do what now? Second. Emails. 

Speaker 1
Emails. Why are my recipients seeing my whole email instead of my name sender name? Is that what you said? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I think that's what it's called. 

Speaker 1
You can show a picture? Yeah. Okay, I'll just send them this and move. Okay, let's see. Photos. I got a free consultation call with Nico. He sent me like one for free, which was fucking cool. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, that's awesome. Was that yesterday or. That's after yesterday. 

Speaker 1
After yesterday he was like, yo. As a early welcome gift to Bali. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Nice. Are you going to see him in Bali? 

Speaker 1
Yeah, well, he's living there, that's what. Yeah, yeah. Okay, now go away, dude. I don't need you anymore. I don't need you anymore. Okay, synergies. We're good on this email. Yeah. Good afternoon. Evening. Good morning, Kate. Yeah. Yes, it mapsil automations. 

Speaker 3
I think we can test that. Yeah, see if that good or bad. 

Speaker 2
Two questions in one. 

Speaker 1
Yes. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Alej. And have a great weekend or have a great rest of your week. Great. Moving on. Yeah, cool. And finally you're just two emails of the other one. Okay. Anyway, we'll get around two more. Think five is a good thing to test? We're testing specific things. It's great. 

Speaker 3
So you want to do what, one more than we have right now? 

Speaker 1
No, not right now. Are more ideas in the email for the CRM automations we haven't touched on. And then there's variations of a couple and then there's a slew of ideas later on, but that's something. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, we got a ton of valuable info in there. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. Awful feeling we made, Emma, just make sure it never happens again. One of the questions is morning capitalize. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I usually do. 

Speaker 1
Cool. Lovely, lovely page from fast rice. We are ready. 

Speaker 3
Let's do it. 

Speaker 1
Nice. Negative is good. Negative is positive. Okay. 

Speaker 3
So now we pause the other campaign and launch this one. 

Speaker 1
Page'S email is not being used in the other campaign. 

Speaker 3
Okay, cool. But the other one's done, right? There's no more emails to send to? 

Speaker 1
Well, no, there were several sequences. Like up to seven days after, up to eight days after. Something like that. 

Speaker 3
Okay, so yeah, let it keep going. That makes sense. 

Speaker 1
Okay. Enable risky emails. Bounce, protect. No, insert unsubscribe link header enable company reply stop contain for company reply stops the campaign automatically for all leads from a company. If a reply is received from any of them, no matches your leads provider with your mailbox provider for boosted deliverability. Yes. 

Speaker 2
Oh, that's interesting. 

Speaker 1
This we don't really want to do right now because we want to keep it manual. We care more about insights and less about performance. 

Speaker 3
Sure, that makes sense. 

Speaker 1
Prioritize new leads, schedule follow ups and max new leads we are going to do. This is nice. 

Speaker 3
Do we need to have follow up emails or no? 

Speaker 1
Well, remember how in Yogi's emails they did open the second email and although the answers weren't positive. It's good. It's good to have. 

Speaker 3
Sure. 

Speaker 1
And we're doing up to 30 emails per we're doing up to 30 emails, warm emails per account. So this is 120 and we can open the new domain for fastrise and new emails. Cool. I have to do some lead cleaning still. 

Speaker 3
I thought you were stretching. 

Speaker 1
No, I'm charging my computer because I get yelled at it. I don't. 

Speaker 2
Then your computer just turns off for some reason. 

Speaker 1
I get yelled at. 

Speaker 3
You need that chinese nuclear battery that can last 50 years. Never plug it in. 

Speaker 1
What are you talking about? 

Speaker 3
Some company in China developed a nuclear battery pack like the size of a smartphone that can supposedly last for 50 years without charging. Seems dangerous. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, right. Especially how much I use my computer these days. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
We'Re going to BCC. 

Speaker 2
Will you just humor me and click on the little circle head icon on the left side. 

Speaker 1
Left side. Circle head. 

Speaker 2
Oh, that's lead management. 

Speaker 1
Please, no more emails because I'm not interested. 

Speaker 2
Please remove me from your list immediately. 

Speaker 1
It is admittedly. Yeah. So these are from today. Would you believe this? Greg retired the lead list. Wasn't that good. But the emails were worse. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
No, we're making progress forward. Slightly disappointing that Yorga is not here right now. 

Speaker 3
Is this being recorded? 

Speaker 1
Yeah, got it. 

Speaker 3
Just curious. 

Speaker 1
Let's see. 30 per campaign getting started. 

Speaker 3
Journey. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. Very strange. Daily campaign warm up is different. I believe we'll find out. Okay, then we'll try one more time and see what happens. Sequences. We preview. Synergies. Kate. Damn. Number one, get inspired. Journey. Send test. We go to the second one. Preview. Kate. We choose page number two. We send. We preview. Paste, Kate. 

Speaker 3
Wait. 

Speaker 2
Change the email. 

Speaker 1
Thank you. We send. We preview. Paste. Kate. Bam. Send. And then finally we, all of them are coming up as page ad. So we will get in touch with. 

Speaker 3
But that's different, right? Or is it the same. 

Speaker 1
Different than. 

Speaker 3
Well, is it her whole email coming up or you're seeing just page and then the ad symbol? 

Speaker 1
Page ad. The full email. I'm just seeing the full email. 

Speaker 3
The full email. Okay, I got you. I thought you meant just beginning. 

Speaker 1
And if I send this one to me and if I send it from Alex, it comes out all right. It's crazy, man. It's super annoying. Okay, well, I will send this to these guys, I will fix that and I'm going to go work on the leads. Which at the end of the day, yeah, we just don't want. I don't know, I don't know what we want. A lot of them are not. Okay, this is what I can do. I grab all emails that are generic and non work and we only send to those. That could be an option. 

Speaker 3
Okay, sorry. 

Speaker 1
I remove all emails that are non work. Gmail, AOL, hotmail, MSN, outlook. 

Speaker 3
What's your leftover pool? Is it still big? 

Speaker 1
Well, we have 850,000. 

Speaker 3
That's what I thought. I think you can delete the. 

Speaker 1
So instead of delete will you not delete? But I should have to make sure that I organize them very well. So I'm doing the thing that we're telling real estate agents not to do, which is use a CRM, don't use spreadsheets. But it's kind of what we got right now. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, it is what it is. 

Speaker 1
But it's exactly what we're saying people shouldn't do. Okay, so I'm going to make a script to make sure we have the right first name. Number one, I'm going to make a script to make sure that AOL, MSN, the general ones, are not in our list. These are emails we're happy with. So we're not burning leads right now. Okay, well, thanks, Zach. 

Speaker 3
No problem. You want to stop the recording? I just want to talk about something real. Yeah.
