Speaker 1
We've got you mentioned membership agreements with the LLC. We talked about the competency matrix contracts.

Speaker 2
We made it to Australia.

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah. I fly in about six.

Speaker 1
So you're going to Thailand. Is that what heard?

Speaker 3
Yeah.

Speaker 1
I realized today I'm running these virtual programs twice a year, working with this group we've been working with since 2019, and I realized that the time I have to do one on Saturday at 05:00 a.m. Because of the time difference. And then when we're in Bali, it'll be at 01:00 a.m.

Speaker 2
Eventbrite is being a little annoying and not letting me log in, so I think I'll just figure this later. Okay. Let's see. So things to talk about. Low hanging fruits for real estate automations. So, competency matrix. Did you get a chance to pull up the work that Powell did? Let's take a look at it now.

Speaker 1
Do you have it? Okay, I can share if you don't.

Speaker 2
It's a few messages up in the develop advocates chat.

Speaker 1
Go up to skills inventory. These are the skills that we need to make sure they make sense and they're skills we want to evaluate people on. A lot are dev related, but not all. And then if you go one tab over, there's a proficiency level tab, which he hasn't fleshed out, but we need to establish what that is like. How are we kind of rating people's skills?

Speaker 2
Cool. So what we would need to do is look at these thousand dev skills and address each skill gap.

Speaker 1
As far as proficiency levels, I'm thinking about the one that we use for facilitation, alejo, the awareness, implementation, embody, and mastery.

Speaker 2
We might change the word embodying.

Speaker 1
Fluidity maybe, or naturally.

Speaker 2
Anyway, what I did want to check is if it fills out here. So this is number one. Our job would first be going through these and filling it out ourselves and then start deleting things that we won't need because C sharp will never use. So bubble, I'm aware, exists. Never used it. We will come back to this.

Speaker 3
I downloaded the airtable app on my phone, so I think I could just do that.

Speaker 1
As you all go through it, and I'll go through it too. A lot of the ones that are dev related, I'm going to be either awareness or zero. You can leave notes on any ones that you're like, we're never going to use this. We should just take this out of here. Or if there's something missing, we can add it.

Speaker 3
Don't we need at a fifth skill level, which is before awareness, because some of them we're just not going to be aware of.

Speaker 1
Yeah, we can.

Speaker 2
So in that case, we'll probably not fill out the column or just wouldn't.

Speaker 1
Yeah, he really stepped up and on his advocate duties.

Speaker 2
Yeah, in handy. Let's have a review, cleanup session and launch it. Yay. Okay, wonderful. The important topics that all of us and Bartek explicitly want to know about, which is the real estate project and what does that look like, the things that we agreed to and when will the money come?

Speaker 1
Well, we could. I mean, if we go back to our Figma and look at kind of a project distribution, we could start laying out what that looks like.

Speaker 2
Do you want to share screen and show me what you mean?

Speaker 1
Will you pull up? Do you have the Figma up? I can pull it up.

Speaker 3
Do you remember how there was like project leadership team and then we need to set that up. Who's on that team and then seeing what else.

Speaker 1
Yeah, will you make me co host?

Speaker 2
You can share screen.

Speaker 1
Right here. And then.

Speaker 3
If you go to the left, zoom out a bit. Useful archive. Wait, I'm in a different.

Speaker 1
I'm looking for. Yep, I see you, Henry. Ok, right here.

Speaker 3
So when marketing efforts bring in a lead. When someone else brings in the lead, that's what we'll be looking at.

Speaker 2
Yes. So the last update was profit, lead fee goes in cost. So regardless of who brought it and regardless of how much it is, we make it part of the cost.

Speaker 1
Make a new one. I remember having that conversation.

Speaker 3
Copy and pasted from the other side, right?

Speaker 1
Yeah. Well, we can still look at the other one.

Speaker 3
With this project. But I don't mean like completely new town. Just draw it out differently.

Speaker 1
I think I liked this. Well, this gives a bit of a breakdown of what is project leadership, right?

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 1
Oh, I'm waiting on my.

Speaker 2
Okay. Oh, isn't it that one? Yeah, it's that one. Profit sharing. There we go. So in the bottom one.

Speaker 1
This looks the same.

Speaker 2
That looks the exact same. So if you zoom in, I wasn't going to create, like, a new schema. So the hive brings lead, 30% cost ten to 20%. Yes. There you go. So that is the new change.

Speaker 1
Mess with the lead feed sales and marketing now. Or are we making a distinction because honestly, right now we don't have any marketing efforts really happening.

Speaker 3
Yeah, I think we maybe put that money towards just a bank for marketing.

Speaker 2
So outreach is all about getting the sale. It's not unreasonable that if outreach doesn't make the sale and they don't get the money unless they're involved in a different part.

Speaker 1
I agree with Henry. Given the current state of marketing, I'd be okay putting that 15% towards ad campaign budget.

Speaker 2
So what is our marketing effort right now?

Speaker 1
It's just the videos I've put out so far.

Speaker 2
Oh, you put it out. It's like a YouTube channel.

Speaker 1
I think so.

Speaker 2
Post it on our Instagram and our.

Speaker 3
This is a scenario, say we set it up now without the marketing, but then we have them on retainer and then suddenly we do start doing more marketing efforts. How do we go about that?Speaker 1
Right. 

Speaker 2
How do we go about dividing the retainer? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, because do we have a different template for the retainer and different template for the. 

Speaker 2
I see what you. Fantastic question. The retainer has been established that is purely of the people that work for it. Meaning a dev is assigned to a project in the medium long term and they receive 100% minus costs of the retainer. 

Speaker 1
So here's one thought, and I agree with that. And then the scenario is as we get this project going, we have more video content and sort of demo product proof that marketing would then be working on. That would then come out of another. 

Speaker 2
Marketing fund that would lead to a new sale. So ideally that content from a testimonial is marketing that boosts the next sale. So marketing gets paid. The other thing is the retainer is not only for devs as we realize companies need help with marketing. So a lot of help with marketing. So there's going to be marketing. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Another one could be. Oh, they also want marketing done. 

Speaker 2
Exactly. Okay. In this case, this one is going to be both. It's going to be marketing and dev. Yeah, of course. Just to note, it is very much still initiative based. So if I'm learning the follow up API, I'm creating a GBT with all the knowledge base. I'm recording how I'm making it, all that stuff. That initiative is essentially what gets you paid nowadays, especially with simple projects. Especially with projects that are, oh, Avi is the only person that has the skills in order to complete this is more, we're on more on the basic side. So it's very much initiative based. Go learn it. Go do it. 

Speaker 1
Before. Be helpful to you also to get a sense of what the cost and what we're looking at for this project is the operation shared members of operations. 

Speaker 2
Part of the conversation that we need to have within advocates is who's still an advocate, right. There's two that were cleaned from the group because we have to start making decisions. Lecton Pavan. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
I think about JK, who up until probably a month ago ish has been around, but he's been focused on his own stuff. Haven't really heard from him for a month, hasn't been joining calls or communicating, which is fine. But then the question would be like, who would we include in this operations? And then it goes back to the question we've circled through a few times that does go, I think, align with the competency matrix and the membership agreements of what is an active member and what would you need to do perhaps on a monthly basis to get looped into the operations hub or the marketing hub as a person? 

Speaker 2
Okay. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I think, yeah, I see what you mean. 

Speaker 1
Or is it people in op that are showing up. 

Speaker 3
Also? I feel like there's not much set for operations and this template is set for growth. So when we do grow, we are. 

Speaker 2
Very much, we need to do a pitch deck in 24 hours, dude. The next 24 hours we need Powell to step up and edit his pitch deck that he had done. And that's like heavy load. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
I can also help with that. 

Speaker 2
I have the template also in the background. Of course, there's always stuff going on. 

Speaker 3
Could you send it over whenever it's done as well? 

Speaker 2
Oh, yeah. Ideally we kind of work on it together and you also get a feel for real estate in general. Okay. So yes. For some numbers, let's look at it. 

Speaker 1
Do you want to share your screen, Alijo, since you're doing the thing? 

Speaker 2
Sure. 

Speaker 1
Let me share this real quick because it's. 

Speaker 3
Guys, I probably got like an hour at most and then I probably should stop. 

Speaker 2
Yes, I think I need to focus on the dev thing so we can look at some stuff at the dev meeting. 

Speaker 1
What were working on together. This kind of gives us a template that we can use as we map out the project. And it definitely needs a lot of work, but we have a base with a little bit of branding and I've got to undouble brand it. 

Speaker 2
Love that. There was two decks that Powell shared last time, one for real estate and one for general pitch, or rather in depth AI audit. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah, we'll have to ask him for that shared with us. 

Speaker 2
Could you check your email? Sure. 

Speaker 3
Have you checked the AA resources for the pitch decks? Because I think they might have some, especially regarding retainer and stuff. 

Speaker 1
That's a good idea. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Better retainer sort of thing. Set up template. That explain what I did. The fastest way to find it is probably dropping a message in the channels and just saying. Then Keith will probably just point you in the right direction. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. We've got to get our own canva. 

Speaker 2
Yes, we do. 

Speaker 3
I don't mind canva. 

Speaker 1
Here we go. I think this is what we're talking about. 

Speaker 3
What are you on about? The pitch deck I gave you. 

Speaker 2
You gave me? 

Speaker 3
Yeah. The one that I did with. Why have I forgot his name? Oh, my God. 

Speaker 2
Four. 

Speaker 3
I want to say Eric. It's not Eric. I know his name's not the one. 

Speaker 1
He's finished. 

Speaker 2
Pitch decker for principal Skinner. Oh, she was talking about selling in. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, they're selling. They're going to make a stupid amount of money. This is so ridiculous. 

Speaker 2
Selling metal pins. 

Speaker 1
They're Disney pins. That. People are fanatics. Thousands of them. The things and how to tell whether they're real or fake or whatever. But yeah, they're going to start selling a bunch of them. 

Speaker 3
Are you on about the one I did with Edward for the retail? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I think it's that one. I kept thinking about Edward. It's like, what am I thinking about? Edward? Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Let me share this with you guys. 

Speaker 2
My thing about Edward. Search four. 

Speaker 3
There wasn't a set price in there. 

Speaker 2
But it's going to be 500. Yeah. Which is going to be things like use Opus Pro to edit these videos. Teach Sandra, the marketing person for this team, how to use Opus pro. That's part of what the retainer pays for, right? 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Hey, edit this. Add one action plan. We're not going to charge extra for one more action plan. 

Speaker 1
No, but. Well, the first one or two automations will be free, which are relatively simple. And then some of the other ones will continue to build on. There's a lot of potential for growth. I think a few of them will be connecting action plans in follow up box to Trinder, another company that does to people. Devin will send out anyone who is tagged as a realtor in her CRM. Every quarter there's a trigger. Oh, it's the end of quarter. Now, I'm going to send all of my realtor information to this company and they're going to send out this gift basket to all the realtors. There are parts of the action plans for clients when they reach settlement day. 

Speaker 1
I don't know exactly what she does, but trigger to this other company to send them, I don't know, a bottle of champagne and a note saying, congratulations. That kind of thing. They do a lot of that sort of gifting and thank you touch points for referrals and whatnot. And it takes a lot of time. And she's like, I don't want to have touch this because I need to be talking to realtors and I need to be talking to people who want to buy homes. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. This one's set up in milestones, so project overview and then you've got your milestone. 

Speaker 1
And that makes sense. Yeah. 

Speaker 2
That's something that will change. Okay, looking at this pitch deck real quick. 

Speaker 3
Slide nine is the best one with the. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, sure. Nothing much to share, but this is the pitch. 

Speaker 1
Yes, this one. 

Speaker 2
There you go. 

Speaker 3
So you want Powell to remake this? 

Speaker 2
Sorry. 

Speaker 3
Does Powell have another pitch deck that he's remaking for this project? Yeah. Okay, cool. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, way better design, way easier to follow, I think. Less words, keep it. 

Speaker 1
Purposes. We could take kind of merge this one with the template that I have from Pavel. I have a couple of those templates. Put our language in it and we're good to go. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I think this one's very, I don't know, it looks pretty shit. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I don't like it. Hey, who are all these people? 

Speaker 3
I know, that's what I was thinking. I think maybe I shared the link. 

Speaker 2
Well, there's definitely two people who are not us right now in this deck. 

Speaker 3
Which might be Edward looking at it. 

Speaker 2
And now. Okay, let's get moving. So we have enough time. 

Speaker 1
I'll pull the back up the figma because I think we should look at the numbers. 

Speaker 3
I guess we don't know the fixed cost for third solution yet, do we? Or do we have a ballpark figure? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, the max is $200 a month. The minimum is going to be like probably $50 a month. 

Speaker 3
Are we retainer for the. Are we not doing an upfront fee for the development of just an automation? 

Speaker 2
No, these first two are going to be free. Let's go back. Let's go back. You asked about numbers. Let's look at numbers. I'm going to share screen love. Stop sharing. Yeah, this is the project essentially this automation. Get a text message, create a task and follow a boss and create an appointment on the calendar. That's going to be the first one. It's going to be the free one. And then action plans, which is a hub of all clients. Different clients have different tags and different tags have different action plans. Different sets of tasks. Different sets of tasks, period. Those two we're going to implement for free. Those are the two that feel most needed. Highest necessity, highest ROI to effort ratio. We want to do these programmatically, automatically. So obviously there's API that gets involved, right? 

Speaker 1
And for purposes of the next time we sell this, we should like, let's put a value on what we would charge someone that we're not going to do these for free. We're doing these for free. Great idea for referrals. And my cousin essentially told me whatever you all do for me is just going to be copy paste for my mom, implement the same thing. And she's got a lot of people who need this. So let's figure out what we would charge someone. We're not doing the free for the free. 

Speaker 2
Okay, that's a good idea. Go for the auto scheduler. We're talking about being able to, obviously ignoring cost. The integration is a bit of prompt engineering for all the side cases, special cases of how a person might write an appointment, they might say the place in one message and then the time in the next message. Or maybe it's a back and forth reply, deciding which place. So that'll take some testing. Testing means developer hours. And essentially what I said to her, what I said to Devin, which is pretty well correlated to reality, is like, we'll charge you for developer hours for how much our devs put into it, obviously, plus a markup. So we have to figure out essentially how many hours and how much we actually want to charge. 

Speaker 3
Rate is, I guess because I have no idea what my rate. 

Speaker 2
I think it's $100 an hour. I think all of our rates are $100 an hour. And then the cool thing about how we set up our. So let's start there, then start with the main question, how we set up this profit sharing. The cool thing about it is that, no, this got not well pasted anyway. The cool thing about that is that development is going to get paid by the type of work that they do. So if they're heavily involved or a minor contributor. So those hours at the end of the day get paid what fasterized charges gets distributed to developers based on their involvement in the project, meaning that at the end of the day, some hours, say, for senior engineers, are going to be paid more than for junior engineers that can only have so much involvement in complex projects. 

Speaker 2
This is a simple project. So at a baseline of $100 an hour per project per developer, let's write it down here. $100 an hour per developer. Okay. Great rates it might take. It's already been kind of 1 hour. We're talking. Read the text messages. We have to find the right services we have. And, and it might just be Tulio's API. Honestly. 

Speaker 3
Twilio can just be a lot of nitpicking. 

Speaker 2
In what way? 

Speaker 3
I've always had problems with Twilio. That's why I went with go high level, because so much easier. 

Speaker 2
Okay. In that case, that is the service that does it for you. And it's $150 a month. So that's the thing to keep in mind. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
So the one that does it for me is LC lead connector, but all it does is provide the phone number. So the problem with Twilio was getting the phone number off Twilio. It wasn't the APIs that was trying out, if that makes sense. 

Speaker 2
Getting the phone number off of Twilio, what do you. 

Speaker 3
Like? You know how you can go get business numbers? Getting a business number off Twilio and then setting it upright for use in Europe, you had to go send off loads of documents and then it had be in Europe. 

Speaker 2
Twilio is not the way to go, that's for sure. I got validation of that. And now a second validation from what you're saying. Fortunately, this is us, and this person has their own phone number, and we should use her own phone number because it's not like we're going to be spamming messages everywhere. It's going to be every once in a while there's a message that will need to be replied to automatically, like a confirmation of an appointment. And honestly, even at first, probably even shouldn't do automatic, but would you not rather automatic meaning instead of Devin texting, the message gets sent and Devin never. 

Speaker 1
I think the prompt would need to include like someone sends the task and the task is confirmed by Devin's phone number and then it generates the event. And I know I might be talking V two and I might be getting ahead of myself, but I'm thinking about being a user and having this, which I would love to have. It would be, I think, a huge help if somehow, okay, someone sends a message. Are we good for our meeting tomorrow at 03:00 p.m.. Yes. Confirmed. It makes the event in Google Calendar and there's some sort of notification that goes to Devin that confirms that the event was created in Google Calendar. 

Speaker 2
Yes. 

Speaker 1
So that she doesn't have to go back into Google Calendar and make sure that it's there. And then if she doesn't get the confirmation, she knows that there's something wrong and she can contact us. But it's that validation. And in a perfect world, I just imagine the sounds and the visuals. When you click on Duolingo and you complete something and it's like done, you get that sort of psychological dopamine rush. 

Speaker 3
With some systems I've dealt with. So with go high level, when you want to set up a notification, there's a few ways you can do it. You can do an SMS directly to their phone or they actually have a lead connector app which is like a go high level mobile phone app which is like how they check their casually on their phone or their stats and then they get a notification on that app. So I'd be curious, does follow up have a mobile app and if so, we can probably API notifications to the follow up app, which would also be less costly than sending. 

Speaker 2
Out follow up boss. 

Speaker 1
Googling it right now. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. It might be a white label app. 

Speaker 1
You need a paid follow up boss subscription to use the mobile app. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Which I'm sure she does. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
So we can probably send notifications to that app if not. And what I do is maybe because there'll be loads of notifications we can send in and we don't want to bombard her phone with move stages in pipeline. We only want to deal with made, right? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, we don't know that for sure yet. She might want bombing of like this got confirmed. This moved here, this moved here, this confirmed. We don't know for sure that she does or doesn't want that. User experience. That's what we're talking about on Tuesday. User experience too. 

Speaker 3
Beautiful new lead notification. Know exactly who's calling you. Easy call and textual leads through the app. Yeah. So I think the app is a bit. If we automate the app then she doesn't have to combine her own imessages with her leads, right? She can, but it won't look the same. But for her leads it will look like they're just messaging on imessage but she's actually doing it. 

Speaker 1
So when you say automate the app, does that require a different automation setup or. I'm wondering if the automation. Yeah, I guess it would be. 

Speaker 3
I think it's just more of a focus of looking at the APIs on follow up boss and looking at how we that. Because I also know setting up the SMS stuff could be like an extra two steps for no reason. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. I've been trying to minimize. I did find an integration that makes us not even have to connect Google Calendar, like not have to call it manually to create the event from follow up boss. The Google Calendar event can be created. So that's one less step that we have to do. Connect. And let's see if this sounds like. 

Speaker 3
It could just be customizing their follow up bus account with an automation mind on it. So can you get us access to their follow up boss account with just a fast rise team user? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, definitely. And now I have all of the documentation, the 200 pages of follow up boss documentation, API documentation ready. They're here so we can make a chicket. 

Speaker 3
Okay, you're only sharing one screen by the way. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, we're not following which I don't know if this automation. 

Speaker 2
Okay, now you're in that one or this URL of the API documentation, it just like scraped anyway. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
So if we description just throw it into chat GPT, that's a lot of our work done. 

Speaker 2
Oh yeah, it's a lot of work done. 

Speaker 1
And part of the prompting because when you go back to this version, Alejo, this is actually not the first version that we're starting with because I guess we could. Right now my cousin is using follow up boss personally. It's not connected to her work email. She's working on getting that approved by the company. So it's text message to Google Calendar and it's a text message that's either about an appointment or a meeting or a text message that includes a task that eventually, or maybe even sooner than eventually, we connect with follow up boss because there's tasks that she goes in there and she has her daily tasks that she does. 

Speaker 3
You know what would also be probably very useful is follow up boss. I'm assuming they have really good customer service. 

Speaker 2
Probably do. 

Speaker 3
And if it's high level we could sit in a call with one of the team from follow up Boss for free. 

Speaker 2
I'm actually going to look such a good idea. 

Speaker 1
I'm wondering if her data guy is from follow up Boss. 

Speaker 2
Integrate directly with follow up Boss. Interesting. 

Speaker 3
I don't even have make.com listed there, but it does work with make. 

Speaker 2
Yes, you just need the API part as opposed to the integration. Appointments? Appointments. What I know is that if I go to inbox, there is this like text test text. It's an example inbout reply to me and then I can connect this service which is $150 a month and it would probably take care of most of this is great. This works. This is great for. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Okay. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, Alejo, try download the mobile app and log in. 

Speaker 2
I'm downloading it now. Tasks me how tasks work. You guys can hear the sound. You'll hear the sound enough. 

Speaker 3
I can't hear that. The sound of no, we can't hear. 

Speaker 4
It between tasks that are due today, tasks that have gone past their due date without being complete. Action task. You prioritize your day and focus on what matters until you're ready to take action. Tasks assigned to you will be visible both on the task page and on the individual contacts profile. You can toggle your view between tasks that are due today, tasks that have gone past their due date without being complete, and any tasks upcoming in the future. You can click the lead's name to easily jump to their profile and take action if need be. Or check the box on the left to mark the task as completed. You can also use the filters at the top right to change which tasks you're viewing. 

Speaker 4
For example, if you have a lot of tasks but only limited time, you can use filters to narrow down the list to only view your call tasks for the day. 

Speaker 2
Cool. Okay, so ideally we're creating tasks. Well, no, we're definitely creating tasks programmatically. And now I have my Google calendar connected. So if I create a task on here, let's try it. If I create a task on here, new task, say overdue. I want to. No, I want to add a task. 

Speaker 1
I think you have to go change tasks up at the top bar where it says you're on the p. Yeah, that probably works. 

Speaker 2
I came up with a name for testing environment for our code team. Fast test. Yeah. From me. Date is tomorrow at, say, 01:00 p.m. Set a reminder. Oh, this is what she wanted too, that reminder. Okay, great day before. What time is it in the US right now? In Kevin, check my multiple 05:00 p.m. 

Speaker 1
It's 09:30 a.m.. There. But what time is it for them? I think it's 04:00 p.m. 

Speaker 2
So 930 or four. 

Speaker 1
Are you asking what time it is now? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, right now. 

Speaker 1
04:00 p.m.. 

Speaker 2
Cool. So the call tomorrow is at 01:30 a.m. Our time. Yeah, 01:00 a.m. Our time. 

Speaker 1
The call tomorrow should be our 08:00. 

Speaker 2
A.M.. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, go ahead. 

Speaker 3
Do a notification both ways, so remind them as well. 

Speaker 2
It's what I'm trying to test. Okay. 

Speaker 1
We will be meeting with her our time at 08:00 a.m. On Wednesday the 6th, which is her 04:00 p.m. On Tuesday the fifth. 

Speaker 2
Cool. 

Speaker 3
Is a task the best way to set a call, or is it that meant to be in events and tasks are like prepare for the call. 

Speaker 2
Where do you see events? 

Speaker 3
I don't know. I just know in go high level because my brain goes to the reminder for the task is only reminding you to do the task, not all participants of the task, right? 

Speaker 2
Yeah, correct. It would be for her. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
I'm pretty sure you can assign somebody else, too. 

Speaker 3
Only employees. So I don't know. Is there like a nava way to set an event different to a task? It's just my question. 

Speaker 2
I don't think so. I think tasks is everything here. 

Speaker 1
Well, yeah, you have the task and then you have the calendar, which I think are two different things. And she wants to use her Google calendar because I think she has her. I don't think she's using the follow up boss calendar to manage her life. She wants all of her work tasks in her Google calendar. She also wants all of the lists of tasks, which are the things to do in her high level task list, but also as events on her Google calendar. 

Speaker 3
What we could do then is if the calendar. We don't even need the Google API. You just need to set up two way sync with the calendars so that when she. 

Speaker 2
That's the thing. It's already set up. Okay. So check it out. The event is here. It's created in my Google calendar at 1131 40, my time, and I should now be getting a notification on. 

Speaker 3
Can you do me follow up? Can you set up an event in your Google calendar and see if it transfers back to boss? 

Speaker 2
Yep. Yep. All these events are from my Google calendar. 

Speaker 1
And if you go up to the task on the top bar, just to the left of the calendar, view up all the way up. 

Speaker 2
Gray person. What? 

Speaker 1
Gray the task. So this, I think, is where she puts her actual right. And that came through so fast. Test one came through. So it would list the task here in follow up boss, and then it would also go to Google Calendar. I just wanted to see that because sometimes what's in her Google calendar will be an actual meeting, not necessarily a to do item. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. But then also it's kind of how we use our Google calendars. We put our to do things that we're going to do for the day in our calendar. And I've seen your Google calendar, Henry. I know you do the same thing. That also includes meetings. So it's like everything that you have to do today, whether it's a meeting or a task, is in the Google calendar, which it looks like that went to both places. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. I'm really interested to see how hers is set up and if her calendar events are set up in tasks or just in calendar, if that makes sense. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, I think she has calendar. 

Speaker 3
So for example, say you need to book a call with someone and say you and me and we discuss, we're making a call and I'm the real estate person. Do I log into here and go to tasks and create a task for the call or do I just go onto my Google calendar, create the call? 

Speaker 2
Because if I just, I'm pretty sure isn't going to follow up boss to write who is she meeting with and when. I'm pretty sure she would just write that in her Google calendar. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
Because then it doesn't get set as the task, if that makes sense. 

Speaker 2
Correct. It wouldn't get set as task but the objective would be fulfilled, which is that it shows up in her Google calendar. 

Speaker 1
And that's a good question for her because I see some value in it being in both places. But go ahead. 

Speaker 3
She wouldn't get the reminder. 

Speaker 2
She can get a remembrance through calendar. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, true. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. Which is probably better. So I'm trying to log into the mobile app and then we can proceed to the next topic. Okay, I'm logging in. Yep. Okay. Anyway, so we have the dev meeting in 1 hour and this I would like to bring kind of worked on turn on notifications, open settings. Okay. Email and text messages show up here. If I want to send a text to somebody. Well my number would be recorded in there so we could try that and I can see this test. I don't see the reminder, but that's fine because it does show up in my Google calendar. Okay. So yeah, the answer is yes, it works. Always texting. I send all text via follow up boss. Always text in app. 

Speaker 2
So I would just need to change my phone number to my actual one and that would be that. Okay. What questions do we have? Lovely. So a text out of that. I'll get around to it. We talked about, you had a question? 

Speaker 3
No, I was just saying let's go to the next topic. 

Speaker 2
Okay, cool. We'll get around to these details for now. This looks good. Next topic. Well, I guess topic you asked about profit sharing. Retainers. Retainers, they divided by the people who are assigned, right? 

Speaker 3
Yeah. But you've also got to cover the operating costs. So for example the Opus pro cost per month that's going to be in the retainer. And then you've got the two people, the one person probably just for Opus pro who's doing that. And then you've also got the other general updates to the automations. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. Example, $500 a month retainer, $100 cost per month to one engineer, one marketer. So dollars -100 equals 400, go to 202 hundred marketer. Okay, well, does that help clear it up or does it complicate it? 

Speaker 3
I close it up, it's just. I know, just thinking it won't always be divided evenly. 

Speaker 2
I guess the work will not always be divided evenly. No. 

Speaker 1
Can you. Sorry if I missed it. The $200 for the marketer, that's for Opus Pro. 

Speaker 3
If you're doing marketing services for them. So say if the retainer. Okay, I see marketing services and I want the engineer like the project to be up to date and stuff. 

Speaker 1
Okay, so we are paying marketing out of retainer. I thought that were not. 

Speaker 2
Okay, let's start from the top. So we charge something for a project, a certain amount gets charged up front. That amount gets divided like this. That's one way that we earn income. Way number two, that we earn income. Retainers. Retainers. However much we charge, we reduce the cost, we subtract the cost and then we divide that amount between the members assigned. An example is that if we charge 500 a month retainer and our cost is 100 a month and we have one engineer and one marketer, that means that it's $500 for the retainer -100 divided by two. So $400 divided by two. 

Speaker 1
The math I get. 

Speaker 3
I think the difference is for this, we're paying them out of retainer for marketing, because they're doing marketing not for fast rise, but as a service for someone else, rather than 10% normally, or 15%. That would be, I see, marketing for us. 

Speaker 1
Okay, so this would be specific to this project for the retainer. 

Speaker 2
Okay, just an example. And we have also talked about this being the retainer for this project. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, that's clear to me. I just got confused because when we talked about retainers earlier, we talked about 100% of retainers going to Dev and that the marketers would get paid out of the other revenue share model, which doesn't pertain to the retainer. So theoretically we'd have some kind of project set up or installation cost or fee which would follow the revenue share model. 

Speaker 3
Well, I think it makes sense if you're thinking it depends on what they request as a service. So for example, if they're my Facebook ads every month, you don't want to just charge a one time fee for that. You would want the marketer on retainer for the hours they're putting. 

Speaker 2
Yep. 

Speaker 1
In this case because some of the services require marketing, which might know training. And maybe it's a per month sort of assessment on what the needs are for the project. I'm imagining maybe one month, it's a 50 split. But then maybe once their marketing team is set up, then really it's only the development that's doing the. I don't know. Anyway, so for this project, because we're offering marketing services, a part of the solution, that is why the marketer is looped into this revenue. Okay, thank you. 

Speaker 2
Okay, cool. So what we had left is figuring out how many developer hours takes, which we don't really need to guess right now. We can just figure it out once it's developed. Right. 

Speaker 3
I think one of the things is setting up project leadership and operations. Who's in that before the check comes in and then we suddenly decide who's getting the money. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, well, the check is not going to come in for a little bit, but yes, of course. 

Speaker 1
Question. I know we are doing this. We're just talking about retainer for this project. So do we then not have funds that go back into the business? Are we accounting for that? Or is that included in the $100 cost? Or is that cost specifically the cost of the API integrations? Whatever. 

Speaker 2
We're using monthly costs of this project. 

Speaker 1
But it wouldn't go into. 

Speaker 3
Retainer. So from my understanding of the project, it's not just a retainer, it's that, for example, the third automation we set up would be, let's say it's 1000 pounds. 

Speaker 1
Got it. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 3
And then we're also charging the retainer for maintaining that first project. And say they want marketing because a marketing. Oh, I need marketing help. It's just a service we can probably provide. And we're just into the. 

Speaker 1
Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for helping me. I have jet lag, 02:00 a.m.. Brain. That makes sense. 

Speaker 2
Okay, awesome. So what exactly does this look like and who's in what? Yes, moving on. 

Speaker 1
Yes. 

Speaker 2
Avi is most likely somewhere in here. Engineers? No, in technical lead. Bartech has talked a lot about test driven development, but right now this is very fuzzy. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. We're also talking per project. So this would be split up. It wouldn't be for the whole time we're working with this client. You've got to think that. So it would be. Okay. We're going to charge an upfront cost for the third automation. What's the project leadership team for that automation? Because that's how we're splitting that money. For example, there might be some projects where we don't need Avi, and Avi just doesn't have the time for it. 

Speaker 2
Thus, like now. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, thus he's not on the project leadership team, but for the same client data for maybe a 7th automation, where it's a lot bigger or something. We bring him in on the project leadership, right? 

Speaker 2
Yes. That's why I'm having, in part, why I'm having a conversation with him to see like, hey, where do you stand with us meeting, say, three times a week and talking, like, purely technical stuff? Because as our last conversation, it sounded like couple times a week would be feasible as long as we kind of aligned with his schedule. So all possible stuff. But we do need a highly technical, highly experienced person, and the only person we have with those requirements right now is Abby. Highly rigorous is something that we need because pasting things together is great for prototypes, but we're going to need some more rigorousness rigor. Okay. 

Speaker 3
I mean, Alejo, you could be the technical lead as well, by the way. Easily. 

Speaker 2
I could see how you'd think that it is. Technical lead does not align with the depth that I can get to. Let me give you an example. I'll throw an example out there. AI dialers. AI dialers are great, but they have an issue, which is latency. And if it came to, hey, how do we solve the latency issue with our calls? Because it makes it sound very much less human when they take a couple of seconds to answer whatever, continue the conversation, I would have no fucking clue where to start. A technical lead would at the very least know where to start, what questions to ask, and be able to wrap their head around latency, what the issues might be regarding it. That's not where I shine. 

Speaker 2
So I am doing everything I can to not be technical lead on purpose, and if it came to it, I know I would do a good job. I know I would do a decent job at technical lead, especially for these sort of low sophistication projects. 

Speaker 3
Lejo, do we remember what was the third automation project that we had kind of lined up for? 

Speaker 2
It wouldn't be for this client. It would be for about half of her referrals, which is leads in a spreadsheet. Get migrated to follow up boss. That's the third one. 

Speaker 3
Let's just build out the template for that. So leads in a spreadsheet to follow up boss. That's one project. So that's one where you could easily be the technical lead, for example. And then I think project leadership is less of the, my main focus was towards operations and the guys because I also feel like us three are doing a lot of the operations just by having this call alone. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, absolutely. And that is at the end of the day, what counts. And let's figure out how you can make that explicit. That's requirement, like showing up and the flexibility around showing up because pulling out a pitch deck in three, four days to means showing up even if Paul is not in this meeting right now. So we have to figure out. 

Speaker 3
Kind of, I don't think Josiah would need to be here for this call exactly, but for example, creating a pitch deck and being there to speak to the client and maybe like an hour call before, just explain that. What would we think about that sort of input, of just. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, so we met up with Powell on Friday. We talked for like a couple hours and we gave him the whole lowdown on the project. And then during the call he pulled out, oh, hey, I also have these two decks. We could modify them and they would be more than appropriate for our call. So again, flexibility, that counts. It feels like when it counts, we can depend on them, at least on Powell. 

Speaker 3
Well, yeah. The way we set it up anyway was whoever brings in the lead is the project lead. So that's you two guides, and then you basically have the freedom to choose who you want on the project and who you want. I mean, I guess operations. 

Speaker 2
I hear what you're saying you want this year. 

Speaker 3
But not in the whole project actually. 

Speaker 2
Right? Yes. 

Speaker 1
What might help us is, and I'm trying to pull up this pitch deck right now to just start mapping this out. Because if we can get a high level view of the phases of this project, then we can start to get a sense of the level of expertise that we're going to need. Are we going to need super deep development on taking a picture of new leads and putting them into follow up, boss? Probably not. Probably something that between the two of you on this call could happen. And then we look at phase four, who are we going to need? What kind of automation are we talking about? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, is there anything else left to cover? 

Speaker 2
Too many things, but we took a bunch of time on this and it's fine. So we'll have to kick it for next time. 

Speaker 3
What are the things? 

Speaker 2
It's on the discord competency matrix contract for real estate project we haven't touched on contract. We haven't touched on membership agreement with the LLC. So the official agreement that everybody officially signs low hanging fruits for real estate, preparing a virtual event for fasterize so we're launching content on video leading up to a virtual event ops and advocates requirements. And then new members vote, which is Zach. The vote for him to become a member is due. And then Hooby and Leo is in one month. Leo is a friend of mine in sales. So those are all the topics we touched on, which is fine because we have to go deeper. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Okay. 

Speaker 3
Also, one question I've got, which I know is you know how the companies in both of your name, right, officially, when would I get my name on there as a founder? 

Speaker 2
Okay, let me add to the list then do research on the right country to open up a multinational, multi founder LLC or corp. And that's what we have to do research on until we know that we can't. Really. 

Speaker 3
I'm fine to just leave that in the backlog for ages, just until we sort of get flowing. But could it not just be the case that I just get like, you know, how we've already got the faster LLC? Why would we be creating another one instead of just maybe you just can't add someone in like that. 

Speaker 2
Do you have your Social Security number for the US? 

Speaker 3
The US? I have my UK Social Security. Do I need to be. 

Speaker 2
At the very least, you need to have a tax number in the US, which is doable. And we have to do that for every single member in every single country. The US is just not the right place to go through that ordeal. 

Speaker 3
I don't want access either, to be honest. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
And then when it comes to actually managing the money in the bank accounts, you need to be in person, and I'm pretty sure show a US ID. 

Speaker 1
I'm wondering if the workaround or whatever is how we, like, write it as a part of. Not that we have bylaws or anything like that, but kind of establish the ownership structure with the founders in it that aren't necessarily connected to the registration of the business in the US. Does that make sense? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, I'm fine with how it is now. It's just like in the future when, say, the money does start flowing in. I do want my name on documents and stuff, but. Yeah, it's fine. I know it's complicated. We'll figure out. 

Speaker 2
Henry, would you repeat that? 

Speaker 1
Do you have your audio turned on? 

Speaker 2
No. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. Can you say that again? Sorry, Henry. 

Speaker 3
Oh, I was just saying. Oh, it is fine. Because I know it's all complicated with us all being around the world, but yeah, I said eventually, when a lot of money does start my name on. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
And it's important and we've got to figure out how we make that feasible with international. But thank you for bringing that up, and let's do research on it. 

Speaker 3
I mean, there's a lot more urgent matters before that, but, yeah. I got to go pack, guys. 

Speaker 1
Okay. 

Speaker 2
We see you in 30. 

Speaker 3
For a dev meeting. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. Audio only. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, maybe. I can probably pack quite quickly, to. 

Speaker 2
Be honest, but, yeah, we do kind of need you in that meeting. I. Because we need to make some decisions. I'll bring in a demo, and we can go from there. 

Speaker 3
Okay, cool. No worries. 

Speaker 2
Thanks for being here. 

Speaker 1
Bye, Henry.
