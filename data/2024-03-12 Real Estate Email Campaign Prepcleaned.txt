Speaker 1
Ask what thinks about it.

Speaker 2
This could be white.

Speaker 4
Refactor the whole project into something that even a junior developer could follow, understand and improve upon. 

Speaker 4
This is the original code personalized outreach system. 

Speaker 3
Through the system we want to create first touch bases with the people we want to connect with. 

Speaker 3
So retrieve LinkedIn profile. 

Speaker 4
Experience in recent posts through the relevance AI API. Read our knowledge base to understand how the profile is relevant to fasterize and its real estate products. 

Speaker 4
The lead in what ways is this lead? A relevant lead for a business and for our offer. And then icebreakers or hooks based on the LinkedIn profile info and these gold nuggets about who they are and who. 

Speaker 4
Log all these icebreakers into airtable to then do manual review and make sure that the whole system is aligned with pasteurizes values and what we're aiming for. 

Speaker 3
Then we draft an email based on prospect profile and a critic agent will. 

Speaker 4
Evaluate how human this email actually sounds, if it has our tone, if it has our brand, how well it flows and how relevant it is to the prospect's profile. 

Speaker 3
And next, the writer agent will rewrite the email, taking all the information that we've created so far. 

Speaker 4
So it's about 600 lines of code. When you take in the actual person's profile, when you take in the actual knowledge base, it becomes about 2000 lines. 

Speaker 4
Relevance AI is an incredible platform where you can create pretty much any tool you imagine. 

Speaker 3
It barely consumes any credits. So through the relevance tool, we are capturing every detail about the profile.

Speaker 4
Make a prompt for AI that will take a long Python file, understand the project deeply, and break up the code into different files to make a proper repo. 

Speaker 4
Thus, how many and how which files get created needs to be very flexible.

Speaker 4
Feel where it's giving itself instructions, it's requesting itself to enrich the prompt, it's asking itself for perspective, and then it will summon expert agents to help them brainstorm. 

Speaker 4
Write a comprehensive readme. Let's see if it can actually write the code. You can move forward. Feel free to take it as autonomously as possible from here. 

Speaker 3
I'll start the refactoring process now. 

Speaker 4
However, when I asked it to code each step, each actual file, it did a mediocre job.

Speaker 4
It's just putting the functions in and saying, hey, here's where the logic goes. 

Speaker 4
But the repo that we need is actually a lot more intricate because there's a lot of things going on and we need organization to be a priority. Remember, we need a junior dev to look at the repo and be able to navigate, understand each file, understand how each file interacts with each other, and figure out how can I improve the project. 

Speaker 3
So Chai GBT didn't do a fantastic job with the same prompt, with the same exact prompt. Now asked Claude to tackle on this project. 

Speaker 4
Analyze the code, create a new project directory, then intuitive structure.

Speaker 3
Let's see if it can actually write the code. 

Speaker 4
We will refactor the process autonomously and things are going back on in the background, but things are not going on in the background actually. 

Speaker 3
So I have to be great. Move forward. 

Speaker 4
Structure setup code refactoring and it's telling. 

Speaker 3
The things that it wishes it had done or it would do if it had this autonomous something going on in the background sense. 

Speaker 4
The main py file now serves as the entry point of the application, orchestrating the flow by importing and utilizing the necessary modules and functions. 

Speaker 3
Let's go through each file and create an action plan to complete the missing code scrape profile.Speaker 3
Word that references as important. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, and there's a model that recalls. 

Speaker 3
It and there's a model that can't. Let's go, Claude. Okay. 

Speaker 4
Implemented the code for scraping LinkedIn. 

Speaker 3
Profiles using the relevance API, added error handling. 

Speaker 4
Let's go, dude. Okay, so if we go back. 

Speaker 2
I. 

Speaker 1
Make it look more spammy. 

Speaker 5
Sorry. 

Speaker 3
Please now create a markdown tree of the composition of the repo. Let's go, let's go. 

Speaker 5
Wow, that is beautiful, dude. 

Speaker 3
Okay. Wonder what that code actually looks like. Oh my God, that's beautiful. Okay, let's go to Figma, we can. 

Speaker 4
Get her done. 

Speaker 3
Or we go to visual studio and start a new project. 

Speaker 4
Spaghetti rock. 

Speaker 3
Doesn'T say lula now even. 

Speaker 4
Know which repo I'm trying to clone. 

Speaker 3
Let's go baby. Let's go baby. Got shitty. So. 

Speaker 4
Wonder if it would like meta. 

Speaker 3
Create a thing of the structure of the project. Be interesting. So I need you to exist a o yes. 

Speaker 1
So it's. 

Speaker 3
Okay. So let's reshare to include code and we have this. 

Speaker 4
So let's create file by file. 

Speaker 3
New file main py. Well, you know where to save it. Dude, why are you asking me? New file LinkedIn, new file LinkedIn scraper, py agents, templates, tools. Da da da da da da. 

Speaker 4
It knows that outputs is going to be a series of things. 

Speaker 3
That's fantastic. 

Speaker 4
Readme. 

Speaker 3
Requirements txt new file, I got submits and let's look at it. We got the config JSon file, bam. We have the, we'll get around to putting each one. Well would you know which ones those are open like key. Can you like code complete? No, why? Cody, I want you doom, doom doom. Okay, I guess not, but I don't need Cody right now. 

Speaker 4
So we'll get around to that. 

Speaker 3
Let's just copy paste this, which is the airtable utils we need to create an environment. Please create an environment, a virtual environment. Please help me create a virtual environment using. Is it puppeteer or poetry? 

Speaker 5
Tools. 

Speaker 3
Tools. 

Speaker 5
Py. 

Speaker 3
Agent templates. 

Speaker 5
Bam. 

Speaker 3
Scrape LinkedIn profile which is part of LinkedIn scrape and that's that. And now we have the main py file. Yay. So all of these have their purpose. Their space is the IPO inb and we just need the readme. 

Speaker 5
Because it. 

Speaker 4
Tried to do a readme, didn't it? 

Speaker 5
It. 

Speaker 3
Terminal. What is my shell configuration file? I see this after install. What is my shell configuration file? How can I find my shell configuration file? Mac m one e o e s. Nano cookie. 

Speaker 5
Cookie. 

Speaker 3
Hzczshrc and then I add a export. Okay. 

Speaker 4
And then I add. 

Speaker 5
That didn't work. 

Speaker 3
Source. 

Speaker 4
Bro. No way, I just use source correctly. Let's freaking go. 

Speaker 3
Okay. Guide you through creating our. Well, can I skip because I know I have a worked, thanks. I have a requirements txt file. How can I give it to poetry instead of individually declaring each package after poetry? Oh, okay. It's just version 0.1. Author Kuba and Lejo. Three point ten. Yeah, three point ten. Find your main dependencies interactively. No no. Yes. Okay. Noise. So bam. What do you mean doesn't exist? Oh wait, there's no requirements file. Wait, why didn't you create the requirements file? 

Speaker 5
There we go. 

Speaker 3
Yay. 

Speaker 5
Damn. 

Speaker 3
How about now? How about. 

Speaker 5
Now? 

Speaker 3
Hope I'll figure that one out later. 

Speaker 4
That is unnecessary. What I do need is the number one API keys. 

Speaker 3
So let me get these from this. Lang chain tracing. Lang chain API key config. Lang chain. Lang chain. 

Speaker 5
What? 

Speaker 3
Think it's missing something? Some important stuff. At which point is it actually? 

Speaker 4
Okay, so what we'll have to do. 

Speaker 3
Is say hey, therp API face ID. Face ID. 

Speaker 5
Table name emails. 

Speaker 3
Icebreakers. 

Speaker 5
You. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, it has been a while. What have you, what have you been up to? Sleep. 

Speaker 5
Yeah, fair enough. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. You've been taking some trips. 

Speaker 1
Oh nice. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, we've been bouncing around quite a bit as well. We're in Australia now and be heading to Bali in the next. 

Speaker 5
Week. 

Speaker 2
To two weeks. Yeah, that's where we're relocating to base up. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Super excited. Yeah, we both really love it there. 

Speaker 1
And it'll give us a longer Runway to get things going with faster eyes and. Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Well, let's see. The update is we have our first client. Super exciting. 

Speaker 1
It's actually my cousin who is in. 

Speaker 2
The real estate industry. 

Speaker 1
She's a mortgage loan officer and when. 

Speaker 2
We were in Maryland. So my cousin and my aunt both. 

Speaker 1
Work in the mortgage space, and they invited us to this workshop on AI. 

Speaker 2
And chat with their AI guru. 

Speaker 1
And, yeah, we met a bunch of. 

Speaker 2
People, and we ended up talking to the speaker for a little while. 

Speaker 1
He was so excited, and he's like, oh, my gosh. Well, you all are doing the thing. 

Speaker 2
I'm just here talking about all these tools and everything, but you guys are doing it. 

Speaker 1
You all should come up and speak. 

Speaker 2
So on the fly, we got up. 

Speaker 1
And talked a little bit at this. 

Speaker 2
Presentation, and it went really well, I think. We vibed with a lot of people. 

Speaker 1
And we had a couple of one one meetings with my cousin and. 

Speaker 2
My aunt, and we sat down with my cousin. 

Speaker 1
She's like, okay, this is the year. 

Speaker 2
Of getting all of my systems done. 

Speaker 1
And I want this set up. 

Speaker 2
That's my goal for the year. She came to the table with tons. 

Speaker 1
Of ideas and tons of things that. 

Speaker 2
She wants to automate. 

Speaker 1
And we're starting with the sort of client relationship management part of her business. 

Speaker 2
Not even getting into the mortgage just yet. 

Speaker 1
But it's been interesting learning a. 

Speaker 2
Lot about just that in the real estate industry and what she does and film time, so much of it is relationship. 

Speaker 1
And from what she was saying, she's. 

Speaker 2
Like, I don't need to be doing. The only thing I need to be doing right now is talking to realtors and talking to people that want to buy homes. All of this admin stuff I want off my plate kind of thing. And she knows a lot of people. So we're doing the first couple automations. 

Speaker 1
For her for free, and then she. 

Speaker 2
Has a whole list of things. 

Speaker 1
So there will be some paid work. 

Speaker 2
As well, and then it'll be a copy paste for a lot of the. 

Speaker 1
People that she works with. 

Speaker 2
So that's where a lot of our attention is focused right now. But it's super exciting. And, yeah, the first automation we're building is a text to Google calendar integration. So she gets a text from someone that's, you know, this person, can you send over the pre approval letter for so and so? And it generates a task in her CRM, and then it will populate a calendar task on her Google calendar, and. 

Speaker 1
It'Ll do the same thing for event. 

Speaker 2
Requests that come through her text. And then we're building out some other automations within her CRM, which she uses a CRM called follow up off she loves. I'm not sure if you've heard of that one, but it's specific to the real estate niche. 

Speaker 1
And one of the things that she does, her, and so she and her. 

Speaker 2
It'S actually her best friend from childhood. 

Speaker 1
Who is a realtor. 

Speaker 2
They're both like number one realtor mortgage folks in the state of Maryland. And a lot of what they do. 

Speaker 1
For client appreciation and loyalty is they'll. 

Speaker 2
Send out gift baskets or handwritten notes during certain phases of their clients within the CRM. Kind of like a lot of CRMs, you can do this, you can build out your own automations. 

Speaker 1
And in follow up, boss, the automations. 

Speaker 2
Are called action plans. 

Speaker 1
So she's working on getting all of her action plans set up, and then we'll go in. And when a certain, like for a. 

Speaker 2
Realtor, for example, every quarter, she wants. 

Speaker 1
To send all of the realtors in her CRM a gift basket. 

Speaker 2
She's already working with outside companies that put gift baskets together and send them. 

Speaker 1
Out or make handwritten notes and send them out. 

Speaker 2
So we will set up that external integration. 

Speaker 1
So Q one hits, end of Q. 

Speaker 2
One hits, the automation triggers, and all of her realtor information gets sent over to the company that she's using for the gift baskets, and they go out and she doesn't have touch anything. 

Speaker 1
So similar process for. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
So that's what we've been focusing. 

Speaker 2
A lot of energy on, as well. 

Speaker 1
As building out a knowledge based system. 

Speaker 2
Which we're starting with fasterize. 

Speaker 1
So starting with all of the meeting. 

Speaker 2
Recordings and getting the transcriptions from those to build a knowledge base. 

Speaker 1
So we can create a system where. 

Speaker 2
Anytime we need information, we can ask it and it'll provide it. 

Speaker 1
And the idea is it's evolving. 

Speaker 2
But if we're implementing this for another. 

Speaker 1
Company, it's designed with certain Personas to. 

Speaker 2
Give information tailored to what, let's say a salesperson might need versus a CEO. So the Persona will deliver to that person the role specific insights that they. 

Speaker 1
Need for whatever they might be doing. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Exactly. Like building it out and seeing what we need it for as insight for what other companies can use it for and then going from there. But I think once we get these first couple of automations done for this. 

Speaker 1
Client, then we'll start moving into replicating. 

Speaker 2
These automations and getting into her referrals. She's got tons of referrals. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Going into the real estate agents. 

Speaker 1
Which she was telling us that some. 

Speaker 2
Of the loan officers and some of the realtors that she worked with don't even use CRMs. They're still managing things on Excel. And when we met with her, she. 

Speaker 1
Was like, there is real data that. 

Speaker 2
Correlates realtors and loan officers who use CRMs make more money. 

Speaker 5
It's like, well, that's a brainer. 

Speaker 1
But just to hear the data come. 

Speaker 2
From her was interesting. Yeah, she's aware of it, and there's a lot of win because if the people she's working with have streamlined systems, then everyone makes more together, especially. 

Speaker 1
With how closely tied real estate agents. 

Speaker 2
Have to work with mortgage loan officers. And at least in the US and. 

Speaker 1
In this state, you're usually affiliated with an agency, but otherwise you're a freelancer. 

Speaker 2
And you're going out and you're getting your own leads. So another project we're working on is. 

Speaker 1
An automated outreach system that is able. 

Speaker 2
To scrape LinkedIn profiles and then generate. 

Speaker 1
Unique messages that speak to that specific person. 

Speaker 2
And I think there's a few ideas we have floating around for how we can implement this for them. 

Speaker 1
Because it wouldn't be LinkedIn, it would be Instagram. A lot of real estate agents and mortgage lenders are all on Instagram. 

Speaker 2
They do a lot of self marketing there. And that'll be one thing we work with her team on. She's already hired a woman to manage her social media, but there's some inefficiencies and a little bit of misalignment with the branding that she wants quality. So that'll play a part of this eventually. 

Speaker 1
But yeah. 

Speaker 2
That'S what's been going on in faster eyes as well as Bartex. I don't know if you ever got a chance to use prompt factory assistance. 

Speaker 5
Okay. 

Speaker 1
Bartex, it's great. 

Speaker 2
Bartex made like several iterations on it since perfecting it and it's really awesome. So I've actually been working on making some use case videos for PFA and I'm working on just videos in general to get more marketing content. 

Speaker 1
Our marketing is kind of fizzled in the moment, but the priority has been. 

Speaker 2
The client and outreach. 

Speaker 1
So that's where we're at. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
I think there's been some phases. 

Speaker 2
Where the discord has been a little less active. I think we're getting back, finally getting back into our rhythm after the holidays and whatnot. So. Yeah, we've got. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, right. 

Speaker 2
Yeah, I think that's the idea. And I'll have to get more updates. 

Speaker 1
From exactly where the dev team is with it. But yeah, it's a huge project that. 

Speaker 2
Then we can also use for our own outreach campaigns. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
So it's been very exciting. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. Please share. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Fair enough. 

Speaker 5
You. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, that's a good awareness that you've. 

Speaker 2
Come to about yourself and what you. 

Speaker 1
Actually want to be doing. Because I've actually had a similar revelation of, like, I don't actually enjoy the. 

Speaker 2
Making posts and whatnot. 

Speaker 1
There's a part of this that I'm. 

Speaker 2
Doing because things need to be done. And I'm very excited to turn over. 

Speaker 1
All of the digital marketing to smma specific folks that are psyched about it. And I'm focusing on, what I really. 

Speaker 2
Want to focus on is the education and the training and the human development within faster eyes, and also how we're sharing value and knowledge with the community. 

Speaker 1
Around using tools and AI and how. 

Speaker 2
People can use this to benefit their own lives. 

Speaker 1
I think it's in alignment with video. 

Speaker 2
Content that we need to create for marketing anyways, so I'm finding some parallel lines with it. 

Speaker 1
Well, aside from crypto, are there any. 

Speaker 2
Other parts of AI or this world that you're interested in learning more about? Like, are you interested in development, or are you exploring where you want to kind of apply your strength? Okay. Yes. Mmm. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Oh, damn. 

Speaker 5
Okay. Yeah. 

Speaker 2
I think that's a good place to start. 

Speaker 1
Just kind of getting back in the. 

Speaker 2
Loop and even chatting with people one. 

Speaker 1
On one, you have time might help. 

Speaker 2
Find some ideas or find a place. 

Speaker 1
Where you feel like you might fit. 

Speaker 2
And if you're interested in crypto and forex trading, I would recommend reaching out to Alejo because he's just turning around and looking at me as I'm saying this, but he's done a lot of that. Was it forex you were teaching classes on? 

Speaker 1
Yeah, he's okay. 

Speaker 5
He actually started in a different life. 

Speaker 2
Seven, eight years ago on teaching people in Latin America about forex trading. So, yeah, he's like, in a different life. He was doing that. And very much the strategies that he's running for investment right now is largely centered on crypto. 

Speaker 1
So, yeah, you should chat with him about. 

Speaker 5
It. 

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Not the forex trading so much anymore, really. It's crypto. 

Speaker 1
It's less hands on with day trading. 

Speaker 2
More to, like, long term crypto strategy. 

Speaker 1
Is where he's at right now. Yeah. 

Speaker 2
He'S been planning for this moment since 2020. Hold on, I'm going to take you out of my headphones. 

Speaker 5
What's up, dude? 

Speaker 4
That's a funny picture. Hopefully no showing to him. 

Speaker 2
No, I'm on discord. 

Speaker 5
Can you hear it? 

Speaker 3
Hey, man. There we go. How are you doing? 

Speaker 4
Good. I'm glad you're on the crypto train. 

Speaker 6
Yeah, one of my friends has been on this stuff for years as well. 

Speaker 5
Cool. 

Speaker 6
Trying to get all the cash going. 

Speaker 5
A bit late to it, so I. 

Speaker 6
Just trying to get as much money together right now. 

Speaker 3
Cool. 

Speaker 4
Have you invested anything at all? Have you invested anything at all? 

Speaker 6
Yeah, I buy a lot of coins and stuff. Enough capital to go through the bitcoin. So I've been enjoying these communities and stuff. This guy called Dr. Profit who just does all these signals of that. And so far I've liked two x already. Every coin I've got into. 

Speaker 4
Cool. That's really good to hear. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 6
Waiting for the actual. Was it like the super cycle to start? 

Speaker 3
Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 4
Well, I'm glad you're learning about super cycles. 

Speaker 3
Keep your money in, my man. Keep your money in for now. 

Speaker 4
Keep your money in for now until. 

Speaker 2
It'S time to take it out. 

Speaker 6
Yeah, take it out before it all drops. 

Speaker 3
You're doing any forex? 

Speaker 6
Well, I was thinking about starting to learn Forex. I haven't actually started yet. 

Speaker 5
Really? 

Speaker 4
Cool. 

Speaker 6
I just kind of wanted to learn the skill and make money as I seen it. Forex is one of the easiest ways. 

Speaker 5
I can just do it. Just down to me. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. You know what, the thing about Forex. 

Speaker 3
Is that it's very marketable because the. 

Speaker 4
Charts, because the big numbers and there's this thing that people always show you, which is the actual losses. As big as you can make, you can lose. And I was there when this whole forex hype started in 2017, 2018. 

Speaker 3
No wait, earlier, 2015, 2016. 

Speaker 4
I don't know if imarkets live or wealth generators. 

Speaker 3
Ring a bell? Yeah. 

Speaker 4
Good. Stick with crypto, bro. 

Speaker 3
Stick with crypto. Yeah. 

Speaker 4
Forex looks like a lot of fun. It's not as fun and not as profitable as crypto. 

Speaker 3
Okay. 

Speaker 6
Would you say just learn how to trade crypto instead? 

Speaker 4
I would say figure out. Learn how to quote unquote trade crypto. 

Speaker 3
In the medium term. 

Speaker 4
Don't do like I get in the morning and I get out at night. Don't do like twelve hour strategy. Definitely not like minute to minute trading. Find dips that are obvious. Set up limit orders. Like, hey, if tomorrow, Ethereum, that's a 4000 today, or in the next week drops below 3500. Yeah, have a buy order there. That's always a good idea. But I'm going to buy at 4K, I'm going to sell at four one, and then I'm going to buy again at 450 until it goes to 4300. 

Speaker 3
You're going to end up sometimes losing money, but the stress that you're going. 

Speaker 4
To go through is just not going to be worth. So take the route of learning crypto, meaning how does the market move? Who are the whales? How do you identify when a whale is moving its money? How do you read indicators of supply and demand? And all those things are very useful. 

Speaker 3
Okay. 

Speaker 6
Yeah. Is there anywhere I should go to start learning about this properly, or is this just something I can have to. 

Speaker 4
That's a great question. 

Speaker 3
I'll find you something. 

Speaker 6
I appreciate that. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. It's a great interest to have, especially when the super cycle starts. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 6
Markets. 

Speaker 5
It would be crazy. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. It's about to get nuts. 

Speaker 4
And just so you know, strategy I'm taking is a time based strategy, not a price based strategy. So I'm taking from the halfing, which is happening in a month. 

Speaker 3
A month? 

Speaker 4
That's crazy. I've been waiting for this for four years, man. Three years. The halfing starts in a month. And from there, I'm doing a time span of four to six months. So in August, I start taking my money out. 

Speaker 3
At whatever price it is, I start taking my money out. 

Speaker 4
And in October, I finish taking my money out. 

Speaker 3
So I know I get a big rally. 

Speaker 4
I might not be the most profitable investor on earth, but I know, well, I'm already 100% up. 

Speaker 3
Right. 

Speaker 4
We're already 100% up, and we've seen the cycle happen and we know it doesn't last forever. 

Speaker 3
And we also know that if you try to time it, this is going. 

Speaker 4
To be the peak of the price, 99% of the times, you're going to be wrong. So take the profits when they're in. 

Speaker 3
Your hand and you're happy with them. 

Speaker 5
And set a strategy. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 6
They're not more about having a goal and having an endpoint in mind. It's just taking profits when you're there. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 5
Trying to get the best. 

Speaker 4
Well, that's the hardest part, actually taking the profit. It sounds dumb, but it's like you hit your goal and every bone in your body will tell you to stay. 

Speaker 3
In the market and you have to. 

Speaker 4
Look at the piece of paper where you committed to, this is the number or this is the time, and actually. 

Speaker 3
Click the sell button. It's the hardest part. 

Speaker 5
Yeah. 

Speaker 6
Well, this is my first real cycle. 

Speaker 3
Cool. Gnarly. 

Speaker 6
After the first cycle, everyone loses out. I'm going to try and be that person. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, it's doable. It's hard. Most of us lose money on our first time around. For me in forex, I actually lost $2,000 in five weeks. Yes, because somebody had signals and the signals worked and I followed. And that just happened to be the month that it was a bad month, but somehow the next month was also a bad month. Yeah. It's hard to trust in that market because it's easy to show the earnings. 

Speaker 3
But nobody will show you what the reality is. Yeah. 

Speaker 4
So I'm happy to help with some resources and what I can for proper education. 

Speaker 6
I'd really appreciate that because I am quite interested in this. 

Speaker 5
Good job. 

Speaker 3
Keep learning. 

Speaker 4
And it's a great market to get a job in. Dude, there's so many jobs around crypto, not only programming, not only trading. There's such a big thing that after you graduate uni and whatever, it's a great place to find a job too. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 4
So there are companies within crypto called their dows. 

Speaker 3
Right. 

Speaker 4
Decentralized autonomous organization. And those require a lot of smart people that understand the inner workings that might not be actively trading the coins, that might not be programming the networks, but that can, for example, find out a need in the market of the, say, economics finances market. And that's how XRP got created. Hey, banks have a really hard time trading with each other internationally. Corporations have a very hard time. It's very expensive. So they created XRP with that use case in mind. And those weren't traders. Well, not necessarily were traders and not necessarily were programmers. They just found needs. And from there to managing a community, you can get paid for managing communities on discord. And these communities get very large. There's all kinds of jobs beyond programming and trading within the space.

So if you want to be part of the community, there's always open arms. And thank you for letting me know because we're about to sort of purge the discord of a lot of people that have been inactive and you're showing interest. It's like well, I'll leave you in because you want to be in.

Speaker 1
Realization that it's like marketing. 

Speaker 2
Sounds cool, but I don't actually enjoy doing it. 

Speaker 3
Cool. 

Speaker 2
And, I mean, that's an awareness. Things we learn of learning what we don't want to do can be just as important and insightful as what finding the passion and what we really want to be spending our time doing.
