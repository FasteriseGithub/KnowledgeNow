## KnowledgeNow System Context
KnowledgeNow is a multi-assitant AI system designed to harness and contextualize the vast knowledge generated within organizations, transforming textual data from meetings, messages, documents, and other sources stored in a Vector Database Knowledge Base into actionable insights. Each assistant within the system plays a specialized role in processing, evaluating, and enriching data to answer user prompts with accuracy and depth, working collaboratively across a sequence of stages from initial context enrichment to final answer formulation. 
In KnowledgeNow, a human "user" prompt initiates a workflow where a Context Enrichment Assistant refines the user prompt using a global context document about the organization, a RAG Extractor assistant then optimizes it for querying the Vector Database Knowledge Base, and an Evaluator assistant assesses the results, all leading to an Answer assistant that formats the final, context-rich response.
